10.31637/epsir-2026-1898;Introduction: Urban regeneration in Latin America has become established as a strategy for reversing socio-spatial fragmentation and neighborhood deterioration. Methodology: A qualitative-comparative analysis of ten representative cases in diverse contexts was developed, organizing the evaluation into four categories: local development, urban metabolism, connectivity, and green infrastructure. Results: It was identified that sustained community participation strengthens the appropriation of space and social cohesion; efficient water and waste management, together with nature-based solutions, improves the microclimate and resilience; and pedestrian and bicycle connectivity links neighborhood networks and access to services. Discussion: Successful cases combine collaborative governance, environmental education, and sustainable mobility; however, challenges remain in terms of scaling up, territorial equity, and impact monitoring. Conclusions: Effective urban regeneration requires comprehensive approaches that integrate citizen participation, environmental sustainability, and mobility, incorporating gender and care criteria to ensure equitable benefits. Replicable guidelines are proposed for intermediate cities in the region aimed at consolidating local economies, strengthening green infrastructure, and improving quality of life. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-024-00190-9;In this paper, we use a decolonial lens to reflect on a place-based transdisciplinary Nature-based Solutions (NbS) research project that focussed on the multifunctional retrofitting of a stormwater detention pond through coproduction in Mitchells’ Plain, Cape Town. We find that stormwater ponds represent promising yet contested leverage points for coproducing NbS towards water resilience in Cape Town. We also find that ‘scaling deep at the margin’ is an important initial condition for experimenting with NbS in contexts of deep difference. Here resistance and desire are central dynamics that may help rework the unjust power asymmetries in the post-apartheid city. Researchers need not foreclose the possibilities of failure in transdisciplinary NbS experiments when resistance is encountered, instead they should explore the generative insights that may result from failure. We conclude that sustainability transitions in the Global South may be more productively understood as contested, seldom-complete endeavours in which justice remains the goal. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s41598-025-16693-z;Nature-based solutions (NbS) can mitigate the climate crisis and provide co-benefits to biodiversity and human well-being. We identified opportunities for NbS in the US by mapping both critical habitat for birds under a changing climate and carbon stocks and sinks. We then investigated the alignment of these locations with areas important for human well-being and land-dependencies. Finally, we identified High Priority NbS areas that align with irrecoverable carbon to focus conservation efforts on places with significant long-term carbon storage potential. Although ~ 30% of US lands have some protection, < 3% of protected US lands align with priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being. Of the 312 million acres of priority areas for birds, carbon, and human well-being identified, 71% lack legal protection or formal conservation plans (14% of US lands). Targeting such areas for NbS conservation and restoration would help achieve equitable climate benefits by guiding conservation investments to marginalized communities, while also ensuring maintenance of lands that are critical for biodiversity tracking a changing climate. At least 80% of all birds, carbon, and human well-being priorities co-occur with local communities who have cultural and socioeconomic ties to the land, making it imperative to work with these communities to achieve successful conservation outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2025.100271;Urban climate change threatens rapidly growing cities, which are responsible for 60–75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. These cities face risks from urban heat islands (UHI) effects, extreme weather events, and socio-economic inequalities. Despite current research attention, a comprehensive synthesis of trends, knowledge gaps, and future directions remains limited. This study addresses this gap by conducting a dual-method analysis of 489 Scopus-indexed publications (2004–2024) using Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software. The findings revealed exponential publication growth (21.84% annual rate), driven by post-2015 climate agreements, with thematic evolution from foundational climate science to solution-oriented governance, nature-based solutions (NbS), and justice frameworks. Six clusters emerged: UHI dynamics, governance and equity, NbS integration, infrastructure resilience, sectoral adaptations, and regional inequalities. Although motor themes like urban adaptation and UHI dominate, niche areas (health impacts, urban climate resilience) and geographic inequities persist, with a limited representation of African and Latin American research despite high vulnerability. Key advances include methodological innovations in remote sensing, participatory governance models, and recognition of migrants’ climate marginality. However, fragmented institutional coordination, epistemic injustices in NbS implementation, and policy-replication challenges hinder progress. This review calls for equity-focused, interdisciplinary, and South-South collaborations to better inform inclusive, resilient urban climate strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s43247-025-02706-2;Market-based instruments, including competitive tenders, are central to funding global environmental restoration and management projects. Recently, tenders have been utilised to fund Nature-based Solutions schemes for Natural Flood Management, with the explicit purpose of achieving co-benefits; flood management and reducing inequities. While multiple studies consider the efficacy of Nature-based Solutions for tackling inequities, no prior research has quantified whether the resource allocation for these projects has been conducted equitably. We analyse two national natural flood management programmes funded through competitive tenders in England to explore who benefits by considering the characteristics of projects, including socio-economic, geographical (e.g. rurality) and flood risk dynamics. Our results suggest that inequity occurs at both the application and funding stages of Nature-based Solutions projects for flood risk management. This reflects wider international challenges of using market-based instruments for environmental resource allocation. Competitive tenders have the potential to undermine the equitable benefits of Nature-based Solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00261-5;Trade-offs in nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized, with novel research interrogating their justice implications. Yet, these trade-offs and justice implications remain entrenched in an anthropocentric orientation, which is problematic in ecological and ethical terms. We discuss four common assumptions on trade-offs in NBS (instrumentalism, neutrality of science, collaborative consensus, and unitemporality) and rethink them through a multispecies justice lens, maintaining that dealing with trade-offs is a form of interspecies politics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2025.100261;The potential of nature-based solutions (NBS) to support transformative change is gaining wide attention. NBS are attractive to policy- and decision-makers because they can generate biodiversity gains, alleviate poverty, mitigate climate change impacts, promote local economic opportunities, offset biodiversity loss and advance efforts towards social justice. This paper considers a set of urban NBS mainstreaming tools for the City of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, developed within the context of a grant-funded project. The development and ‘performance’ of these tools are analysed, in terms of their potential to support transformative capacity. This qualitative practice review shows that the NBS tools supported transformative capacity development components such as effective engagement of intermediaries and co-production of knowledge. Multiple entry points for transformative capacity and opportunities for iterative reflection and action are ideal for supporting transformative capacities during the course of a typical project. However, a deliberate approach to capacity enhancement is necessary to achieve more targeted outcomes for urban transformation by applying NBS tools. Without purposefully planning for capacity enhancement, positive outcomes may be present but fortuitous, undermining the potential for NBS mainstreaming to lay foundations for transformative change. This critical review of NBS practice suggests that purposeful incorporation of transformative capacity into project design and practice, including enabling conditions for practitioners and funders, is key to directing transformation through NBS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00252-6;In response to climate change, cities are increasingly implementing nature-based solutions (NbS) like schoolyard greening. This study investigates the Parisian OASIS program—a large-scale initiative to renature schoolyards—through arthropod biodiversity surveys and interviews with 21 stakeholders. Findings reveal that green schoolyards host diverse arthropod communities, comparable to those in urban green spaces, contributing to ecological connectivity and multispecies justice. However, realizing their full potential requires significant shifts in urban governance, long-term management, and inclusive social appropriation. Justice is key: ensuring all school communities—especially marginalized one—benefit equally from green infrastructure. The success of these NbS depend on biodiversity-informed practices and sustained engagement from educators, students, families, and city officials. By integrating justice into design and implementation, green schoolyards can become transformative spaces for more equitable and inclusive NbS in urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s41598-025-07578-2;Urban Green Spaces (UGS) are critical for fostering ecological sustainability and social equity in rapidly urbanizing cities like Islamabad, Pakistan. This study aimed to comprehensively map and classify Islamabad’s UGS, identify spatial disparities, and evaluate their ecological, recreational, and social functions. The research also proposed sustainable strategies for managing UGS to address urban challenges, including climate adaptation, biodiversity loss, and social inequity. The study developed a detailed spatial map of Islamabad’s UGS using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and high-resolution satellite imagery. Seven typologies were categorized and analyzed, including parks, playgrounds, institutional green spaces, and waterways. Field surveys and random sampling validated the thematic maps, achieving an accuracy rate of 95.68% based on statistical metrics like Kappa coefficients. The study revealed significant disparities in UGS distribution. Wealthier zones had larger, well-maintained green spaces, while denser areas lacked accessible and functional UGS. Recreational spaces, institutional greenery, and waterways played a vital role in enhancing biodiversity, urban aesthetics, and community well-being, though many remain underutilized or degraded. Institutional green spaces contributed significantly to urban sustainability, comprising 17.05 km² of the total UGS area. The research highlights UGS as an essential Nature-Based Solution (NBS) for addressing urban challenges like heat islands, stormwater management, and social inequalities. The findings serve as a model for other rapidly urbanizing cities seeking ecological and social balance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2025.100244;Human activities and climate change drive the degradation of marine ecosystems, which provide essential services such as carbon sequestration, coastal protection, and fisheries. This loss amplifies societal challenges, including climate change mitigation, disaster risk reduction, and socio-economic vulnerability. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) offer a strategic approach to address these challenges by protecting, managing, and restoring coastal ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and human well-being. Despite growing recognition of NbS, large-scale implementation remains hindered by funding constraints, policy integration barriers, and difficulty scaling effective strategies. Here, we present a systematic literature review investigating these factors in marine ecosystems to improve our understanding of investment motivations and co-interventions. We analyzed 39 case studies of NbS interventions and 32 studies on implementation opportunities and barriers. Our findings indicate that ecosystem restoration is the most prevalent NbS intervention in marine systems, often initiated in response to extreme climate events and disaster risk reduction. However, successful implementation frequently requires complementary strategies, such as income diversification, to reduce anthropogenic pressures and enhance livelihood resilience. Moreover, we identify synergies between addressing societal challenges and promoting ecosystem recovery, offering valuable insights for managers and researchers. To scale NbS effectively, barriers related to financing, policy integration, and technical expertise must be addressed. Our findings highlight the need for integrated, adaptive solutions linking ecological restoration with community-based management and sustainable economic development, ensuring resilience and social justice. Future research should explore innovative marine NbS approaches that support human well-being and acknowledge nature's intrinsic value. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2025.100240;The study explores the application of a Theory of Change (ToC) framework in 18 large-scale freshwater restoration projects within the context of the European Green Deal and the recently adopted Nature Restoration Regulation. By leveraging a participatory approach, the research examines the effects of freshwater restoration measures across three ecosystem clusters: peatlands and wetlands, small streams, and large rivers. In a conceptual model, restoration measures were connected with transdisciplinary goals, assessing biophysical, social and economic outcomes. The findings highlight the effectiveness of Nature-based Solutions in advancing climate resilience, biodiversity gains, and social equity while identifying potential trade-offs and negative effects. The ToC framework proved valuable in guiding restoration planning, facilitating stakeholder engagement, and enabling adaptive management in accordance with the Nature Restoration Regulation's requirements. However, the study underscores the need for clearly defined quantitative targets to enhance systematic monitoring and evaluation, ensuring full and sustainable alignment with broader European objectives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00224-w;Effective nature-based solutions for biodiversity conservation hinge on knowledge of how people experience the outdoors in everyday life. However, relationships between human and non-human species are rarely combined into empirical models that operationalize research questions about multispecies justice. We examined how psychological drivers of pro-environmental behavior (PEB) interfaced with ecological conditions to understand urban human-bird interactions. We conducted surveys in racially and ethnically diverse neighborhoods of two neighboring US cities. Self-efficacy and social normative beliefs increased private sphere behavior like creating more bird-friendly yards, whereas only social normative beliefs increased civic behavior like volunteering to improve wildlife habitat. These data were examined alongside seasonal bird point counts. Latent variable path modeling results showed that summer bird richness predicted perceived diversity, and in turn, aesthetic charisma of birds, and attitudes toward resource management. Our comparative and social-ecological research engaged diverse populations and offered new solutions to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00205-z;The design and implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) in cities are often limited by an anthropocentric approach that prioritizes utilitarian goals instead of the diverse needs and abilities of multiple species that would support ecological flourishing. This paper starts from the premise that multispecies justice (MSJ) thinking provides a needed biocentric approach to NBS, and explores how a Capability Approach (CA) can be a bridge to integrate MSJ into urban NBS. The premise was tested through an embodied methodology used to design and deliver multi-city workshops in urban novel ecologies; settings often described as abandoned and hosting novel ecosystems. This research improved the understanding of participant’s awareness and knowledge of more-than-human agencies in shaping space and time, and in identifying social and environmental vulnerabilities and opportunities that can foster or hinder multispecies flourishing. We conclude by exploring how the CA can bridge NBS and MSJ and argue for the potential of marginal, less-valued novel ecologies as important elements of socially and biodiversity-rich urban futures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00207-x;This paper explores the ways in which urban green and blue spaces are beset by problematic governing processes that reinforce an unrepresentative and unjust environmental narrative. In efforts to operationalise Nature Based Solutions this is problematic for, ultimately, law may act to ‘freeze’ the environmental narratives that shape our urban ecosystems. In many cases the results will not adequately recognise multiple species or provide an adequate basis to learn from the self-organised resilience of ecosystems with a long history in place. In this paper we use an Australian case study to demonstrate that a once extensive plant community that was extirpated over the past 150 years is now unknown and unrepresented in environmental law and policy, despite its value for Nature Based Solutions. We suggest that modest regulatory change can act as a vehicle for more-than-human representation within existing decision-making processes. Improved representation of disrupted and marginalised ecologies may achieve the functionality needed for effective Nature Based Solutions and allow urban ecologies to flourish. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1038/s42949-025-00191-2;While substantial efforts have been made to identify and address issues of environmental justice in urban areas, the question of how to consider and plan for the concerns of humans and other species remains a major challenge. This paper provides a conceptualisation of what 'justice' might mean from a multispecies justice (MSJ) perspective within the contexts of nature-based solutions (NBS) and urban sustainability planning. We offer a wider conceptualisation of representation, distribution and agency compared with dominant framings in NBS scholarship and provide exemplar cases on how to integrate these concepts in planning discourse. We critically discuss some of the challenges and opportunities of considering MSJ when confronted by established procedures and practices in NBS science and decision-making, focusing on (i) moving beyond existing standards for biodiversity conservation; (ii) embracing MSJ as a process and practice; and (iii) building the capacity of NBS planners to work with MSJ. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.compchemeng.2025.109276;Sustainability has become a central focus in global discourse, demanding solutions that integrate three critical goals: net-zero emissions, nature-positive outcomes, and people-positive development. Progress in emissions and resource reduction exists, but integrating net-zero, nature-, and people-positive goals remains limited. This study applies the open-source Chemicals and Materials Industry (CMI) model to assess environmental, economic, and social impacts of polyester fiber production, spanning current and emerging technologies. The model was validated against literature, and sensitivity analysis highlights circularity as a key lever, capable of reducing emissions by up to 40%, though often requiring significant investment and risking widened social inequalities. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs. While biobased materials and renewable energy can enable 100% emission reduction, they may simultaneously drive resource extraction, biodiversity loss, and land use change. Global-scale assessments further show that even if country-level trends appear sustainable, the cumulative impact may exceed safe and just environmental limits. These insights underscore the importance of evaluating decarbonization strategies not only by emissions, but also by their broader ecological and social implications. To align climate goals with ecological restoration, we quantify nature-based solutions. For instance, forests sequester ?0.5 kg CO<inf>2</inf>/m2/year, allowing decision-makers to calculate reforestation needs for emissions offsets. This approach makes nature-positive pathways measurable and actionable, transforming ecosystem services into integral components of climate mitigation. Simultaneously, improving labor conditions and access to sustainable inputs supports people-positive goals but can raise production costs. Despite trade-offs, combining renewables, biobased feedstocks, and circular practices creates win–win–win pathways—cutting emissions, restoring ecosystems, and promoting equity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128973;Nature-positive initiatives have emerged as a promising strategy to make urban areas more biodiverse and liveable in the 21st century. There are, however, many gaps in our understanding of the motivations and mechanisms through which grassroots urban greening practices emerge in cities, in particular in understudied social housing programmes. We examine 38 interviews conducted with residents of social housing developments in Bangkok, Thailand, to create a typology of attitudes and values that reflect how people conceptualise, implement and maintain urban nature. Our analysis further identifies five main types of behaviours that characterise how urban nature is negotiated within communities. Using the Urban Nature Futures Framework, we provide insights into how local priorities and decision-making processes can be integrated into the planning of urban nature. Building upon growing debates on climate justice, we examine how these behaviours can influence the implementation of nature-based solutions and climate adaptation projects in understudied contexts in the Global South. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128979;Urban tree cover (UTC) is a commonly used metric in policy and management activities, including urban forest resources assessment, equity and distribution, and ecosystem services modelling. Despite the well-established benefits associated with urban tree canopy, declining tree cover has catalysed many cities into setting UTC targets. In this short communication, we used an assessment of UTC targets set by 57 cities worldwide to discuss the merits and drawbacks of setting UTC targets and to inform recommendations for setting effective UTC targets. We found that UTC targets range in ambition, varying between 4 % and 50 %. To meet these targets, cities would have to increase their current UTC by between 0.47 and 23.3 percentage points within stated timelines of between 3 and 51 years. We found that cities with lower current UTC set ambitious targets, requiring relatively large annual increases in canopy cover. Moreover, cities in xeric or dry biomes set lower targets (< 20 %) than cities in temperate or tropical biomes (> 25 %). We found that setting UTC targets can provide a range of benefits, but achieving a UTC target at the expense of other indicators of urban forest structure and quality poses risks. We reflect on pathways to set specific, measurable, achievable, resourced, and time-bound UTC targets, while acknowledging the associated issues. This exploration of UTC targets will help ensure that UTC remains a useful metric for urban forest management and planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128937;Urban greening is increasingly recognized as a nature-based solution (NBS) to address climate adaptation, social equity, and biodiversity conservation challenges. This study explores the innovative potential of schoolyards as key elements of urban green infrastructure (GI) to enhance ecological connectivity and support biodiversity in fragmented urban landscapes. By focusing on four European cities—Barcelona, Brussels, Paris, and Rotterdam—the research combines spatial modeling and ecological network analyses to assess the current and potential contributions of schoolyards to urban functional connectivity for tree-dependent species. The findings reveal marked spatial contrasts, influenced by historical urban planning and vegetation distribution, with schools near large green areas offering the highest connectivity gains. While individual schoolyards yield modest improvements, their dense spatial distribution presents a strategic opportunity to densify urban ecological networks, particularly in vegetation-deficient zones. Beyond their ecological value, green schoolyards provide co-benefits such as urban cooling, enhanced learning environments, and increased social cohesion, embodying the multifunctionality central to NBS frameworks. By integrating biodiversity goals with broader social and climate objectives, this research offers scientific insights to guide urban greening strategies, emphasizing the ecological potential of schoolyards to densify connectivity and support urban biodiversity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land14091884;As cities struggle to balance affordable housing, sufficient public green space, climate change, and rising temperatures, the urgency for planners to integrate nature-based solutions into urban strategies is magnified. In Poland, social inequalities and neighborhoods with limited access to green areas often characterize cities. Urban strategies are needed to increase environmental justice and mitigate climate change impacts. In a survey conducted in Poland (n = 963), a cluster analysis identified four groups based on their living situations, rating of green spaces, and climate change. The results illustrate differences in perceived impacts of heat waves with one group demonstrating a high tolerance towards heat waves, although they live in unfavorable housing conditions. Green space use varies depending on accessibility and distribution in their neighborhoods. Context-sensitive planning is required to ensure more equitable urban planning in Polish cities, which allocates for both the environmental and social needs of the city. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.buildenv.2025.113361;"Urban street shading is a proven, cost-effective strategy for reducing pedestrian exposure to extreme heat, yet its equitable distribution across social groups in dense metropolitan areas remains understudied. This research evaluates the distributional justice of street shading (encompassing both tree shading and artificial shading) in Shanghai's central urban area by combining 163,571 Baidu Street View panoramas, deep learning-based semantic segmentation, building height-based simulation model, and census data from 2408 residential communities. We found that: (1) Both natural and artificial shading are heavily concentrated in the urban core; (2) Children, non-local residents, individuals with lower educational attainment, and low-income groups experience significant shading deficits; (3) Buffer areas between developed and developing zones face dual challenges of insufficient and unequal shading coverage; (4) Nearly 47.8 % of residential walking spaces require additional street tree planting, while 13.2 % could be rapidly remediated with artificial solutions such as awnings or umbrellas. We advocate a hybrid shading strategy that combines rapid deployment of artificial structures with long-term investments in street trees to maximize cooling benefits and advance climate justice. These insights can help policymakers better target shading infrastructure efforts and alleviate heat-related health disparities in urban communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.envsci.2025.104154;The European Union (EU)'s commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 relies significantly on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies, yet implications of such approaches for the Global South remain unclear. Here we reflect on how land-based CDR ambitions in the EU—particularly BECCS—may generate disproportionate pressures on ecosystems and communities in countries like Brazil, which have become a focal point for climate mitigation due to their biophysical potential and geopolitical ties. Although Brazil is not formally committed to providing land-based offsets to the EU, its significant potential to host large-scale afforestation and BECCS projects renders it a useful case study for exploring these dynamics. Under a stylised exploratory scenario in which Brazil accommodates the full external land demand for BECCS, we estimate that up to 10.2 million hectares (Mha) would be needed by 2030, and between 100.3 and 152.5 Mha by 2050. This level of land use could lead to substantial socioenvironmental risks, including deforestation, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and the displacement of local and indigenous communities. Drawing on past experiences with extractive green initiatives, we identify risks associated with predatory green projects—such as land use conflicts, food insecurity, and the erosion of Indigenous rights and knowledge—which raise concerns aligned with notions of green neo-colonialism. Furthermore, this increased demand for land could jeopardise Brazil's capacity to achieve its net-zero GHG pledge by 2050, which relies heavily on nature-based solutions, such as ending deforestation and promoting large-scale native vegetation restoration. We recommend a set of integrated and participatory policy approaches that prioritise procedural justice, ensure transparent international cooperation, and mitigate the unintended impacts of global CDR strategies on vulnerable ecosystems and communities. This work advances the conceptual understanding of the multi-layer environmental and social implications of the EU's CDR strategy, highlighting its transboundary effects and potential tensions between Global North priorities and Global South equity considerations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecoleng.2025.107706;In this paper, we closely examine the case of the Marker Wadden, a nature restoration project with recreational opportunities in the Dutch lake Markermeer. The Marker Wadden – a mud island concept – has been constructed using locally sourced building materials (sediments from the lake) and is designed to withstand natural dynamics such as storms and waves. Lack of funding and financing has been repeatedly discussed and identified as a key barrier to implementing and upscaling ecological restoration, or Nature-based Solutions (NbS) in general. This highlights the importance of studying a unique case, such as the Marker Wadden, where this well-documented barrier has been overcome. We aim to identify the financial arrangements made and how they came about. We adopt the rounds model (a policy analysis theory), apply evidence triangulation, and employ a theoretical framework that captures an institutional perspective on financial barriers. We find the Marker Wadden project to be an example of public and private co-funding for ecosystem restoration. We further find revenue generation from recreational activities leads to partial cost-recovery, and non-public funding sources are unlocked due to the involvement of an NGO. We also find the pre-investment phase to be instrumental in overcoming financial barriers during later (implementation) phases. We surface the main drivers that led to funding for the Marker Wadden project, reveal opportunities for investment planning for NbS, and expose trade-offs in terms of (democratic) equity, efficiency, and environmental outcomes resulting from the combined public, private, and philanthropic co-funding arrangements used. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.14445/23488352/IJCE-V12I8P112;Urban resilience frameworks guide cities in addressing the multifaceted challenges arising from climate change, urbanization, and disaster risks. This paper compares 88 global resilience frameworks using mixed methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering, and Thematic Analysis. PCA revealed three dominant dimensions: climate-infrastructure integration, socio-institutional governance, and technological innovation. Clustering yielded four framework typologies: Climate-Centric, Holistic Integrators, Technology-Driven, and Policy-Focused. Major gaps include limited focus on social equity (observed in 62% of frameworks) and sparse representation of Global South contexts. Thematic analysis identified emergent trends in nature-based solutions and digital governance, while highlighting low uptake of standardized indicators like ISO 37123. For India, the integration of NIUA’s local diagnostics, ISO metrics, and community-driven models like ACCCRN offers a viable pathway. This study contributes critical insights for researchers and policymakers aiming to develop inclusive, data-driven urban resilience strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/f16081305;With rapid urbanization and increasing climate risks, cities are facing complex challenges related to environmental degradation and public health. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 1555 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (2000–2025), using CiteSpace and VOSviewer to map global research trends, hotspots, and thematic evolution in the field of NbS and urban health. Results show that research interest in NbS has significantly accelerated since 2020, with Europe leading in publication output and international collaboration. Keyword analysis reveals that early studies focused on ecosystem services and climate adaptation, while recent trends emphasize governance, public participation, and environmental justice. The study also constructs a knowledge framework that illustrates how NbS contributes to urban heat mitigation, carbon management, health co-benefits, and resilience governance. This research provides a comprehensive overview of the NbS field and offers theoretical insights and empirical references for integrating NbS into urban planning, health strategies, and environmental governance, with practical relevance for cities worldwide. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su17157159;Over the past 30 years, the City of Portland, Oregon, USA, has emerged as a national leader in green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). The initial impetus for implementing sustainable stormwater infrastructure in Portland stemmed from concerns about flooding and water quality in the city’s two major rivers, the Columbia and the Willamette. Heavy rainfall often led to combined sewer overflows, significantly polluting these waterways. A partial solution was the construction of “The Big Pipe” project, a large-scale stormwater containment system designed to filter and regulate overflow. However, Portland has taken a more comprehensive and long-term approach by integrating sustainable stormwater management into urban planning. Over the past three decades, the city has successfully implemented GSI to mitigate these challenges. Low-impact development strategies, such as bioswales, green streets, and permeable surfaces, have been widely adopted in streetscapes, pathways, and parking areas, enhancing both environmental resilience and urban livability. This perspective highlights the history of the implementation of Portland’s GSI programs, current design and performance standards, and challenges and lessons learned throughout Portland’s recent history. Innovative approaches to managing runoff have not only improved stormwater control but also enhanced green spaces and contributed to the city’s overall climate resilience while addressing economic well-being and social equity. Portland’s success is a result of strong policy support, effective integration of green and gray infrastructure, and active community involvement. As climate change intensifies, cities need holistic, adaptive, and community-centered approaches to urban stormwater management. Portland’s experience offers valuable insights for cities seeking to expand their GSI amid growing concerns about climate resilience, equity, and aging infrastructure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2025.105395;Nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly used to build urban climate resilience by employing natural features and processes. Implementing NBS in urban residential areas relies on the availability of unsealed soil surfaces. Here we investigate how soil is distributed at fine spatial scales across Los Angeles County, the second largest metropolitan area in the United States, to examine the potential for NBS to be realized equitably. We delineate soil patches in residential areas across a range of socioeconomic settings and urban forms, and then compare soil patch metrics to social vulnerability. Results demonstrate that areas with higher social vulnerability have less total soil area that is also more fragmented and more irregularly shaped. Reduced soil area and soil fragmentation may limit the potential for implementing NBS. As soil availability varies across Los Angeles County in relation to social vulnerability, this study foregrounds soil access as an urban equity issue. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1073/pnas.2315910121;"Nature-based solutions (NbS) have emerged as a key strategy for sustainably addressing multiple urban challenges, with rapidly increasing knowledge production requiring synthesis to better understand whether and how NbS work in different social, ecological, economic, or governance contexts. Insights in this Perspective are drawn from a thematic review of 61 NbS review articles supported by an expert assessment of NbS knowledge in seven global regions to examine key challenges, fill gaps in Global South assessment, and provide insights for scaling up NbS for impact in cities. Eight NbS challenges emerged from our review of NbS reviews including conceptual, thematic, geographic, ecological, inclusivity, health, governance, and systems challenges. An additional expert assessment reviewing literature and cases in seven global regions further revealed the following: 1) Local context-based ecological knowledge is essential for NbS success; 2) Improved technical knowledge is required for planning and designing NbS; 3) NbS need to be included in all levels of planning and governance; 4) Putting justice and equity at the center of urban NbS approaches is critical, and 5) Inclusive and participatory governance processes will be key to long-term success of NbS. We synthesized findings from the NbS review results and regional expert assessments to offer four critical pathways for scaling up NbS: 1) foster new NbS research, technological innovation, and learning, 2) build a global NbS alliance for sharing knowledge, 3) ensure a systems approach to NbS planning and implementation, and 4) increase financing and political will for diverse NbS implementation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

10.1073/pnas.2315911121;Nature-based solutions (NBS) are used to transform existing unsustainable and undesirable path dependencies in cities. For NBS to contribute to just urban transformations, a stronger inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge base is needed. This knowledge base is essential to engage with six complex yet crucial questions about NBS, including “for what?,” “which nature?,” “where?,” “how?,” “when,” and “for whom?.” To address these questions, we identify two critical opportunities to advance the knowledge of NBS. First, we argue for solidifying interdisciplinary approaches to examine how NBS can be designed, planned, and implemented for multifunctionality. Second, we argue that researchers need to work transdisciplinarily with diverse stakeholders to ensure the design, siting, and planning of NBS are appropriate to the context. In both critical opportunities, justice should be a core guiding principle from the beginning of planning the NBS, starting with the foundational understanding that NBS are not inherently just or unjust. Instead, their value depends on a holistic examination of the context in which they operate and the institutional logic that guides their planning. To center justice in the inter- and transdisciplinary research and practice of NBS, a knowledge shift from epistemological injustice to epistemological inclusivity is a critical way forward. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1073/pnas.2315917121;Indigenous peoples have long histories and diverse contemporary practices of caring for and enhancing biodiversity at different scales, in rural and urban contexts. As has been researched and documented by the Convention on Biological Diversity and others, Indigenous peoples globally only constitute 5% of the world’s population and control and care for just 20% of the Earth’s surface yet protect nearly 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. Indigenous peoples have forms of biodiversity conservation that could be characterized as “nature-based solutions” (NbS), or would they be culture-based solutions? Given the extraordinary diversity of Indigenous peoples globally, there will never be a “one size fits all” solution. Yet there are general principles that have been articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that articulate global concepts of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). IKS, TEK, and Native ways of knowing and caring for biodiversity can find both resonance and conflict with what is currently being called NbS. This article articulates Indigenous concerns and critiques of the conceptual and ontological framework of NbS, demonstrating that Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge systems include a similar framework but extend it to include a distinctly biocultural and relational orientation that does not make an artificial division between nature and culture. Different Indigenous perspectives and approaches to sustainability will be highlighted, including two case stories. We conclude with recommendations for respectful, just, decolonial, and transparent ways to explore greater resonance between NbS and Indigenous peoples’ rights. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

10.1016/j.enbuild.2025.115736;Nature-based Solutions (NbS) can address environmental and societal challenges that have emerged in modern cities. However, a challenge that arises with the implementation of NbS is achieving a just distribution of their benefits. A significant body of research discusses the unequal distribution of green spaces and their benefits in cities around the world in the framework of environmental justice discourse. Research on the intersection of NbS benefits and distributive environmental justice has mainly studied the city scale and there is a lack of studies on how small scale NbS interventions affect the local population on a neighborhood scale and their role in addressing distributive environmental justice. In Chania, a green wall and green roof are planned to be implemented on the 5-storey municipal parking building, in a concrete dominated area of the city centre. With this small-scale NbS implementation as a starting point, this paper evaluates its prospective impact on thermal comfort and air quality as well as its implications in distributional justice for the neighborhood. Established indicators for NbS performance and impact evaluation have been calculated: 1. Number of days during which air quality parameters in ambient air exceed threshold values for air quality evaluation and 2. Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) for thermal comfort evaluation. The results indicate the limited, localized potential of the planned NbS and the need for a network of strategically planned small-scale NbS to achieve environmental justice in existing dense urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1088/2752-664X/addd27;"There is growing recognition of the important role that nature-based solutions (NbS)—interventions that protect, manage, and restore ecosystems to address societal challenges—can play in curbing biodiversity loss, combating climate change, and contributing to human wellbeing. However, successfully implementing NbS to balance co-benefits in cities remains challenging. Given the recent proliferation of local, national, and global policies and targets around urban NbS, ensuring successful outcomes of these interventions is critical. This paper introduces a special issue focused on studies that interrogate the process and initial outcomes of several urban NbS projects across scales and geographies, treating cities as complex social-ecological systems. We highlight cross-cutting themes that emerge from this collection of five papers. To better understand and maximize the co-benefits of NbS, we must be prepared to: (1) integrate a wide range of disciplines and methodologies; (2) acknowledge and support the role of local stewardship; (3) deeply consider the role of participation and co-production; (4) re-focus efforts through an anti-racist and decolonial lens, and; (5) better understand the processes underlying the generation of co-benefits. Critically, these papers emphasize the fundamental role of equity-, social justice-, anti-racist-, and decolonial-approaches in successful NbS programs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1177/10704965251317450;This article presents findings of the baseline survey for the project “Nature-based solutions for climate adaptation in the Guinean forests of West Africa” in the context of relevant legal, policy, institutional, and gender equity issues in six biodiverse and climate-change sensitive areas in three countries: Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Guinea. Quantitative and qualitative data suggests that there are differences between the perceptions and/or experiences of male and female actors of many aspects of nature-based climate adaptation, such as perceptions of vulnerability to climate change, levels of participation of women in planning and implementing climate adaptation and reforestation activities, and knowledge of the concept of biodiversity. The data suggests that statutory and customary laws and local norms generally support women’s rights to actively participate in nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, although there are challenges in ensuring that women are fully involved in planning such activities, and benefit fully from them. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/ijerph22060896;Climate-amplified extreme heat events are particularly dangerous for city dwellers. Nature-based solutions such as urban greening may serve as an effective preventative strategy against extreme heat. Driven by historical injustices such as redlining, disadvantaged communities often face limited green space and a heightened risk of vulnerability to extreme heat in urban environments. This paper investigates community engagement strategies for heat-vulnerable community participation in urban greening research as a part of a broader transdisciplinary environmental research praxis focused on multistakeholder co-creation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with community leaders in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods in New York City to explore community co-creation in the design and implementation of tree planting, and compared these themes with interviews with urban tree professionals and other community groups. Overall, the participants agreed on broad themes of environmental justice, intergenerational engagement, community building, and socioecological relationships, although community leaders differed in both a greater emphasis of experiential knowledge and reduced focus on volunteer community stewardship. The findings inform our research process and associated community engagement, including building online resources and addressing community-specific concerns during the research process. We conclude by recommending future steps for facilitating multistakeholder conversations to build inclusive and equitable urban greening heat-adaptive strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land14061306;Urbanisation in the context of climate change and rapid population growth presents an urgent need for innovative and sustainable urban planning. This study introduces the Green Blueprint, an original, spatially grounded, and evidence-informed conceptual framework designed to systematically embed ecosystem services into the planning, governance, and design of resilient and equitable cities in the United Kingdom. Unlike existing research that typically treats Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) as a discrete intervention or evaluates its benefits in isolation, the Green Blueprint integrates cross-sectoral governance, multifunctional land use, and participatory planning into a coherent, scalable model for urban resilience. Developed through a qualitative, interpretivist methodology and critical documentary analysis of secondary data including policy documents, academic literature, and case studies from London, Manchester, and Sheffield, this framework highlights how embedding ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, stormwater management, biodiversity enhancement, and public health into the urban fabric can support long-term climate adaptation and social equity. Rather than serving as a review, this paper advances a novel theoretical contribution through empirical synthesis and thematic cross-case comparison. It further identifies enabling governance structures and implementation pathways to support policy innovation and practical application. This study contributes a transferable planning template for cities aiming to achieve systemic UGI integration, offering clear value for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in sustainable urban development in the Anthropocene. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s10669-025-10014-5;The olive landscape in the Mediterranean region has intentionally been designed and managed for various purposes for centuries. Although this landscape is crucial for the livelihoods of local communities, assessing its resilience remains uncertain due to the limited studies made so far. To contribute to this knowledge gap, this study aimed to assess the resilience of the olive landscape and explore appropriate nature-based solutions (NbS) for its protection and sustainable management in the Akdeniz protected area of Northern Cyprus by employing a range of resilience assessment indicators, a questionnaire designed on a 1–5 scoring system, and focus group discussions. The resilience of the olive landscape was evaluated within the context of four domains. The results showed that although the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem conservation remains at a moderate level (3.29 points), there is a decline in the resilience of livelihood and well-being (2.78 points), traditional knowledge (1.84 points), and governance and social equity (2.67 points), respectively. The greatest degree of resilience was found in the indicators for food security (4.28 points), traditional diet (4.25 points), and lifestyle (4.23 points). However, the overall resilience of the olive landscape was estimated to be low at 2.77 points due to the impact of several landscape change drivers identified (e.g. land abandonment). Therefore, a typology of NbS, focusing on the category and types of NbS, was developed to tackle the resilience of the olive landscape and support the sustainable development of the region. Consequently, the concepts of resilience and NbS can serve as a guiding framework to promote the protection and sustainable management of the olive landscape in the region and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/urbansci9050152;As climate change intensifies the frequency and severity of urban heatwaves, elderly populations are becoming increasingly vulnerable to outdoor thermal stress, particularly in dense Mediterranean cities. This study addresses the critical need for micro-scale, climate-responsive design strategies that enhance thermal comfort for aging residents in historically underserved urban neighborhoods. Focusing on the refugee-built area of Nikea in Greater Athens, this research explores the effectiveness of nature-based solutions (NBS) in mitigating extreme heat through spatial interventions tailored to the needs of older adults. Using ENVI-met 5.6.1, two scenarios were simulated: a baseline scenario reflecting existing urban conditions and an optimal scenario incorporating mature tree planting and water features. The results are analyzed across three key time points—morning, peak afternoon, and evening—to capture diurnal thermal variations. The findings demonstrate that NBS significantly reduce the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), with peak improvements exceeding 14 °C in shaded zones. This study highlights the value of fine-grained, nature-based urban interventions in promoting thermal equity and supporting climate adaptation for vulnerable populations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1088/1748-9326/adc9c5;Nature-based solutions, such as green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) have numerous co-benefits alongside stormwater management, including reduced environmental contamination, improved urban aesthetics, and enhanced community health. However, the implementation of GSI often does not benefit marginalized communities and can exacerbate existing inequities through green gentrification. Here, we propose the utilization of a community-based participatory research approach, which highlights procedural equity issues in communities that have historically been excluded from environmental decision-making and benefits through current stormwater management practices. The study outlines the methodological procedure for building strong relationships with communities through partnerships with well-established local non-profit organizations, working to improve the accessibility of research efforts for participants. Through increased accessibility, we gather detailed accounts of community perceptions of GSI among underserved populations in Northeast Houston and Baytown, Texas. Our results show that community members are broadly in favor of implementing GSI and see it as a means to alleviating the effects of environmental degradation. However, there remains distrust of governmental, developmental, and industrial organizations from past experiences during major flooding events. These insights support the need to actively incorporate place-based expertise and insights throughout the process of stormwater management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128797;Interest in the 3–30–300 green space rule has recently emerged in urban forest scholarship, but its applicability in developing country contexts, especially in intermediate cities, remains largely unexplored. This study assesses the feasibility of the rule's three components—visibility of three trees from every building, achieving 30 % neighborhood canopy cover, and ensuring 300-meter walking access to 0.5-hectare parks—using geospatial analysis. We employ a combination of remote sensing data, local administrative records, and open-source global datasets to evaluate tree canopy cover, greenspace distribution, and accessibility under different scenarios. Our case study focuses on Surakarta, an intermediate city recognized as Indonesia's most livable city. Results show that only 29 % of buildings meet the visibility requirement, 2 % are in neighborhoods with 30 % canopy cover, and 25 % are within 300 m of a greenspace. However, accessibility could increase to 79 % if all greenspaces were fenceless and high quality. Our findings highlight disparities in urban greening, as smaller residential buildings tend to have lower scores than larger office buildings. These results underscore the role of park governance in shaping access to green spaces and the persistent challenges of achieving the 3–30–300 targets. We propose place-based recommendations tailored for each urban commune and advocate for the adoption of the 3–30–300 rule as a target for national and local development planning to enhance urban green space accessibility and equity. This framework has the potential to be used in participatory planning processes for consensus-based siting of green infrastructure and nature-based solutions in cities in developing countries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1073/pnas.2411231122;"Mitigating climate change and social injustice are critical, interwoven challenges. Climate change is driven by grossly unequal contributions to elevated greenhouse gas emissions among individuals, socioeconomic groups, and nations. Yet, its deleterious impacts disproportionately affect poor and less powerful nations, and the poor and the less powerful within each nation. This climate injustice prompts a call for mitigation strategies that buffer the poorest and the most vulnerable against climate change impacts. Unfortunately, all emissions mitigation strategies also reshape social, economic, political, and ecological processes in ways that may create climate change mitigation injustices—i.e., a unique set of injustices not caused by climate change, but by the strategies designed to stem it. Failing to stop climate change is not an answer—this will swamp all adverse impacts of even unjust mitigation in terms of the scope and scale of disastrous consequences. However, mitigation without justice will create uniquely negative consequences for the more vulnerable. The ensuing analysis systematically assesses how climate change mitigation strategies can generate or ameliorate injustices. We first examine how climate science and social justice interact within and among countries. We then ask what there is to learn from the available evidence on how emissions reductions, well-being, and equity have unfolded in a set of countries. Finally, we discuss the intersection between emissions reduction and mitigation justice through actions in important domains including energy, technology, transport, and food systems; nature-based solutions; and policy and governance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.ufug.2025.128731;An unequal distribution of green areas across cities coupled with the vulnerability towards climate change and global warming is causing segregation between residents who profit from nature-based solutions’(NbS) health and wellbeing benefits and those who do not. Residential segregation in urban settings goes far beyond income and socio-economic factors and is also evident in questions of environmental justice, participation and power – including how and where NbS are implemented. Delving into Greek cities, this paper raises the question of whether and how engagement with urban NbS differs within cities and among their residents. By applying a survey with an integrated discrete choice experiment (N = 1002) we were able to analyze the relevance of the type of green area, the effectiveness in temperature and microdust reduction, biodiversity enhancement, time and financial payments and the importance of participatory planning processes. The latent class analysis showed that urban segregation is recognizable within the sample. By investigating the differences in ability and willingness to support urban NbS, this paper recommends how green infrastructure can be implemented in a manner which enforces a more just distribution for those who need it most. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecoser.2025.101701;"Urban projects based on Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are increasingly developed through participatory and bottom-up processes aiming for a more just and equal supply of Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). However, the concept of CES is shaped by underlying assumptions about valuation, governance structures, and power dynamics, which can lead to unequal access to and control over ES benefits. Furthermore, CES are often evaluated post BGI's construction, focusing on distributive justice with limited scope for adjustments. This article investigates how pre-construction bottom-up processes shape the distribution and recognition of CES among communities and individuals. Using an Environmental Justice lens, it examines CES through three dimensions of justice simultaneously, namely distributional, recognition and procedural. This is tested for the case study of Ecovillage Hannover, an ecological housing project in Germany, developed through a bottom-up approach. After using qualitative and quantitative methods, the findings reveal that i.) the co-productive nature of CES influences their unequal distribution ii.) embracing trade-offs through discussions and confrontations is essential to address conflicting CES values; iii.) integrating quantitative and qualitative approaches supports a more holistic and just application of the CES framework. The study offers insights for public policies on the role of BGI in community-led housing projects, demonstrating how CES perceptions and justice considerations can guide more inclusive and sustainable outcomes, especially during early development stages. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.cities.2025.105739;Urban green spaces are increasingly seen through the lens of their contributions to economic growth, neglecting the broader aspects of common goods and social-ecological priorities. Following a ‘green economy’ agenda, the interests of green spaces are acknowledged when they can be coupled with economic interests. Multiple ideas have challenged this neoliberal economic perception of environment–society–economy interactions, focusing on social and environmental justice and multiple values of nature. This paper features degrowth as one such alternative. It proposes a degrowth agenda on urban green spaces, drawing on various ideas that oppose neoliberal governance. It calls for the repoliticisation and decolonisation of green spaces and a broader political commitment to creating a good place for all. This agenda revolves around three aspects and suggests ensuring equitable opportunities to benefit from green spaces for all urban inhabitants. (1) Co-production rather than production: conviviality, care, and commons promote egalitarian opportunities to join greening efforts. (2) Instead of seeing urban green spaces as commodified arenas of consumption, focus on their potential to curb economic throughput. (3) Decentring the human: enhancing multispecies entanglements in urban green spaces to fundamentally alter how people connect to nature. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105282;There has been a surge of academic studies on nature-based solutions in the last decades, reflecting the growing view that nature can help us address the climate and the ecological crises. While definitions of nature-based solutions are commonly referenced in the literature, “nature” itself is rarely defined. This article investigates the ideas of nature in nature-based solutions discourses in urban planning and argues that unpacking their connotations is crucial for a more precise and locally sensitive development of planning for humans and more-than-humans. The findings reveal that “nature” is often used abstractly or through proxies such as ecosystem services or biodiversity. Although the place-specificity of NBS is recognized in the literature, local definitions and values of nature are not sufficiently included, which can compromise the long-term uptake of NBS. The study further highlights the growing recognition of the plural values of nature and the potential for ecocentric approaches to challenge the anthropocentric underpinnings of NBS. The article concludes that unpacking the often-diverging meanings of nature is paramount for a more conscious development of NBS research in planning theory and practice, enhancing the effectiveness, inclusivity, and environmental justice of NBS initiatives and their effective mainstreaming. By embracing plural definitions of nature and fostering a deeper understanding of human-nature relationships, NBS research can support more sustainable, resilient, and equitable urban futures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.25105/urbanenvirotech.v8i1.21415;Law No. 17/2019 declared that the main objective of Indonesia’s national water resources management is one that is managed in a comprehensive, integrated, and environmentally conscious manner, with the purpose of establishing justice and the welfare for the people. Not only stating if the national water resources management must be environmentally conscious, but the law also defines conservation as one of the efforts required for water resources management. Thereby, in the interest of carrying out the formulation and implementation process of water resources management as defined by the law, currently the Directorate General of Water Resources has included water resources conservation as one of its thirteen general policies. Even so, these conservation and environmentally conscious efforts can be found in the operational strategies, goals and performance indicators. Aims: This study was aimed to obtain additional insights can be benefited for the formulation and implementation process in Indonesia. Methodology and results: Corresponding to the recent development in water resources management strategies which have begun to lead into the direction of nature-based solutions, or popularly also known as green infrastructure, this study conducts a literature review on the utilization of green infrastructure as water resources management strategies in several other countries. Conclusion, significance and impact study: Directorate General of Water Resources’ strategic planning document for the year 2020-2024 also indicates if the objective of Indonesia’s national water resources management is still focusing on grey infrastructure, particularly the construction of multipurpose dams. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land14040818;Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs) have gained prominence in urban planning as integrative strategies that utilize natural processes to address complex environmental and societal challenges while advancing green infrastructure development. Despite growing academic interest, the practical integration of NBSs into urban green infrastructure remains hindered by fragmented methodologies and limited understanding of context-specific implementation dynamics. This study contributes to addressing these gaps through a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of 90 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024. It examines the range of NBSs employed in urban green infrastructure, the factors shaping their successful implementation, and the barriers, financial, technical, social, and political, that constrain their adoption. The analysis also explores the roles of key stakeholders, including local governments, private actors, and communities, in the planning, execution, and maintenance of NBS projects. The findings reveal both conceptual convergence and contextual variation in how NBSs are deployed and evaluated, highlighting critical enablers, such as spatial justice, governance integration, financial viability, and technical capacity. By clarifying the conditions under which NBSs function effectively, this review offers insights for researchers and policymakers seeking to embed these approaches within sustainable urban development frameworks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/f16040561;"Intensive anthropogenic disturbances have driven significant spatial disparities and progressive fragmentation of forest-based green infrastructure (GI) that delivers vital ecosystem services across river basins. To address these challenges, delineating ecological management zones and developing spatially targeted GI optimization measures are imperative for safeguarding regional ecological security and advancing nature-based solutions in coupled human–water–forest systems. Focused on the mainstream area of the Jialing River Basin, we establish an ecological optimization zoning system that reconciles forest ecosystem resilience with regional development equity. By using morphological spatial pattern analysis, landscape pattern analysis and the In-VEST model, the GI supply capacity was assessed from three dimensions: element composition, structural configuration, and ecosystem services. The demand intensity was evaluated based on environmental governance pressure, urban expansion demand and social development needs across counties. Supply–demand matching was analyzed using quadrant-based mismatch typology and coupling coordination degree model. The results reveal that the following: (1) supply-deficit counties are predominantly located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, characterized by high urbanization and economic development; (2) supply-surplus and high-level balanced counties cluster in the ecologically conserved upper reaches; (3) low-level balanced counties are concentrated in agricultural zones; (4) the overall coordination degree of supply and demand show a preliminary state of coordination. Based on these findings, the basin was classified into five zones at the county level: GI restoration, management, rehabilitation, enhancement, and conservation. Tailored ecological management measures and policies were formulated for each zone to advance sustainable basin development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/s10584-025-03899-3;“Nature” is a broad term with neither a standard definition nor consistent use, even across federal reports like the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The process of defining complex topics like “nature” is difficult given the broad range in people’s understandings of and relationships with the natural world. To support the development of future nature assessments and NCAs, we analyzed use of nature-related words and themes over time in all five published NCAs and one preliminary draft of NCA5. Overall, despite the prevalence of nature-related topics, we found the term “nature” was not used as much as others like “ecosystems,” though “nature-based solutions” appeared more in the latest NCA (NCA5) compared to earlier NCAs. Additionally, the scope of nature-related chapters in NCAs has evolved from initially focusing on impacts of climate change on ecosystems and ecosystem services towards highlighting solutions that nature can provide and implications for human well-being and environmental justice. We suggest improving the consistency of nature-related terms and topics within future climate and nature assessments to help promote dialogues across disciplines, reports, and assessment chapters, allowing researchers to better tackle multifaceted issues of global change. However, broad standardization of nature-related language may unnecessarily constrict the diverse understandings of nature. Definitions of nature-related terms should be revisited and adapted based on changing views and realities as global changes evolve. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su17073043;People-environment interactions within nature-based solutions (NBS) are not always understood. This has implications for communicating the benefits of NBS and for how we plan cities. We present a framework that highlights a duality in NBS. The NBS as an asset includes both natural capital and human-centred capital, including organisational structures. NBS also exist as a system within which people are able to interact. Temporal and spatial scales moderate the benefits that NBS provide, which in turn are dependent on the scale at which social processes operate. Co-production and equity are central to the interactions among people and institutions in the design, use and management of NBS, and this requires clear communication. Drawing on ideas from culture-based development (CBD), we suggest an approach to communicate the benefits of NBS in a neutral but effective way. We propose guidelines for planning NBS that allow the optimisation of NBS locations and designs for particular outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104266;Neighborhoods encounter various challenges that span environmental, social, and economic dimensions, which threaten both the sustainability of these cities and the well-being of their residents. Presently, urban systems function within a linear and inefficient framework, particularly noticeable in critical sectors such as food, energy, and water. This highlights the critical need to shift towards incorporating Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) within urban neighborhoods. Implementing NBS faces challenges such as financial constraints, land scarcity, lack of technical expertise, limited community buy-in, and maintenance issues. The integration of NBS can enhance the socio-economic resilience of the city on three scales: building, street, and neighborhood. By focusing on multi-functionality, these solutions address multiple issues simultaneously, such as improving insulation, enhancing urban biodiversity, managing stormwater, and reducing the urban heat island effect. The research investigates the potential of NBS to facilitate sustainable neighborhood development, emphasizing economic strategies through closed-loop systems to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, and revitalize neglected and underutilized spaces that detract from a city's overall quality of life. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been undertaken to clarify the scalability potential of NBS within the housing sector, leading to more resilient, equitable, and livable urban environments. This research emphasizes innovative maintenance strategies to ensure the sustainability of NBS across various urban and socio-economic contexts. The review compiles recommendations for conceptualizing NBS for resilient neighborhoods while identifying an execution framework for NBS implementation in neighborhoods particularly those with low-income housing, by engaging communities to promote a sense of belonging and socio-economic resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124717;Land use management stands at the forefront of addressing the intricate challenges posed by climate change while balancing societal needs and environmental sustainability. In the face of climate disasters, such as flooding, the urgency to reevaluate land management practices becomes paramount. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) have emerged as a promising approach, leveraging natural resilience to mitigate climate change impacts, and offering additional benefits like biodiversity conservation and community well-being. However, the integration of NbS into urban planning raises critical considerations regarding climate justice. Concerns revolve around the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens, with the risk of NbS disproportionately benefiting affluent communities. Moreover, the framing of NbS as alternatives or complements to technological solutions raises questions about perpetuating environmental injustices and exacerbating social inequalities. Long-term sustainability and management of NbS, coupled with the need for community engagement and participatory decision-making, further complicate the integration process. The Nigerian context exemplifies these challenges, with existing land use policies struggling to accommodate NbS principles amidst fragmentation and ambiguity. The Land Use Act of 1978 falls short in addressing the needs of stakeholders in informal settlements, perpetuating marginalization, and hindering effective climate adaptation efforts. Against this backdrop, this study aims to unravel specific barriers within Nigerian land use policies impeding NbS integration and climate adaptation. Through insights from policymakers, planners, and stakeholders, this research seeks to illuminate pathways for policy reforms fostering inclusive and effective climate adaptation strategies. Ultimately, the findings aspire to equip policymakers and planners with actionable insights to navigate Nigeria's complex climate adaptation landscape, promoting resilience and sustainability amid changing climatic conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landusepol.2024.107454;With increasing environmental and climate change threats to urban areas, Nature-based Solutions (NbS), including public greenery, are becoming integral components of green infrastructure (GI) networks. These solutions provide multiple benefits in different aspects, including stormwater management, enhanced air quality and improved societal well-being, offering cost-effective and adaptable alternatives to resource-intensive and environmentally harmful grey infrastructure. However, their benefits are often unevenly distributed, resulting in patterns of environmental injustice. This article presents a GIS-based study of the spatial allocation of publicly accessible NbS (PNbS), in Gdansk, Poland, and Rome, Italy. It aims at assessing possible correlations between the socio-economic attributes of the urban districts of the two cities and the density of available PNbS in each district. Results indicate disparities in density of PNbS across different socio-economic layers, more relevant in Rome than in Gdansk, and highlight the importance of informed urban planning. The study supports concerns for fair NbS distribution, pointing to the potential exacerbation of social and economic inequalities, which puts socially vulnerable communities at higher risk of being affected by climate hazards. The results provide insights for policymakers, urging a prioritized focus on districts with crucial PNbS needs.

10.1111/jfr3.13042;"Urban flood risk governance (FRG) approaches increasingly seek to engage local communities—and their surrounding ecosystem in natural flood management (NFM) approaches—to co-produce socio-ecological resilience. This systematic review investigates current approaches, barriers, and enablers of community engagement in urban FRG through a flood risk justice lens. Employing a systematic search and an adapted ‘best fit’ framework synthesis methodology, and reporting results according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses transparent reporting system. The central theme of inclusivity emerged from the synthesis, which integrated sub-themes of relationality, non-universalism, power structures, and personal paradigms in a conceptual model. Results invite FRG practitioners to reframe community engagement as community inclusion in order to respond to the procedural, social, and environmental justice concerns of urban ‘flood disadvantage’ which may be reinforced by current engagement approaches. Critical discussion of evidence—informed by the conceptual model—recognised five principles for realising procedurally just community inclusion; promoting the co-production of integrated community inclusion strategies alongside the communities themselves. The study identified a gap in the literature concerning community involvement in NFM; highlighting a priority for future research with a view to realise more inclusive FRG. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3390/atmos16030258;Intensifying heat from warming climates regularly concentrates in urban areas lacking green infrastructure in the form of green space, vegetation, and ample tree canopy cover. Nature-based interventions in older U.S. city cores can help minimize the urban heat island effect, yet neighborhoods targeted for cooling interventions may remain outside the decisional processes through which change affects their communities. This translational research seeks to address health disparities originating from the absence of neighborhood-level vegetation in core urban areas, with a focus on tree canopy cover to mitigate human susceptibility to extreme heat exposure. The development of LiDAR-based imagery enables communities to visualize the proposed greening over time and across seasons of actual neighborhood streets, thus becoming an effective communications tool in community-engaged research. These tools serve as an example of how visualization strategies can initiate unbiased discussion of proposed interventions, serve as an educational vehicle around the health impacts of climate change, and invite distributional and participatory equity for residents of low-income, nature-poor neighborhoods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128626;"Areas of high tree canopy cover, especially connected tree canopy cover, provide habitat to support biodiversity and cooling to ameliorate the urban heat island effect. However, the nature-based solutions provided by trees are not distributed equally; land use contributes to this systematic inequality because the places where it is easiest to plant trees are often not where trees are needed most. To better understand the gaps and opportunities for tree planting across the urban landscape, we examine the distribution of tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities. We find that parks have the greatest tree canopy coverage followed by single-family residential areas, multi-family residential areas, and industrial land uses. On average, single-family neighborhoods had 8.5 % points more tree canopy coverage than multi-family neighborhoods, with gaps as high as 18.6 % points. Looking at the size of connected tree canopy, we find that residential land uses are home to more small contiguous tree canopy patches (>1 ha in area), while parks have more large contiguous tree canopy (>12 ha in area). We compare the contiguous tree canopy findings to tree planting policy in each city to examine the influence of intentional planning for tree connectivity, and close with policy-oriented implications of our results. Namely, we suggest: 1) closing the gap between single-family and multi-family tree canopy cover, 2) factoring connectivity into tree planting and preservation, and 3) taking a context-specific approach to increase tree cover in industrial areas in order to more equitably distribute the climate, ecological, and health benefits of trees. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1088/1755-1315/1447/1/012019;The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) emerges as a multidimensional approach to achieve sustainable development while enhancing resilience to environmental hazards, in solving the challenges posed by climate change and rapid urbanization. This article examines the integration of NBS in the development of the new capital city of Indonesia, located in Nusantara, East Kalimantan, focusing on its role in climate resilience and low carbon development. Methodologically, the study explores how NBS can effectively conserve green and blue carbon through a synthesis of literature, case studies, and policy analyses, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation efforts. Additionally, the paper examines the potential of NBS in reducing the impacts of hydrometeorological disasters, such as floods and forest fires, which pose significant threats to the region's ecological integrity and human well-being. By leveraging the natural landscape and ecosystem services, NBS can mitigate urban heat island effects, improve air and water quality, enhance biodiversity, and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement, including the participation of Masyarakat adat (indigenous communities), in the co-design and implementation of NBS initiatives. Through inclusive governance structures and participatory planning processes, the new capital city can foster social cohesion, equity, and cultural resilience while advancing sustainable urban development goals. Overall, the integration of NBS represents a transformative pathway towards building climate-resilient and livable urban landscapes that serve as models of sustainability for Indonesia and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144566;"Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are recognized as important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change. To better account for NbS justice implications, theory and practice have embraced Inclusive Climate Actions (ICAs) that simultaneously tackle climate change and urban inequalities. While the (in)justice repercussions of climate actions have extensively been discussed theoretically and empirically, an in-depth assessment of the environmental, economic, and social implications of ICAs is lacking. This research develops a novel framework for evaluating and monitoring the effectiveness of ICAs for NbS. The relevance of the framework lies in its double applicability: the framework has a generic core of 13 KPIs that can be applied for assessment in all European cities, while it can also be integrated by supporting place-based indicators that are specific to each city and NbS project. Prisma methodology, Pareto analysis, qualitative compatibility check, and Fuzzy Delphi methodology are the methodologies used for the selection of the core KPIs. Supporting place-based indicators can be selected though workshops involving local stakeholders. The framework helps cities to implement ICAs that result in more than just delivery of NbS by distributing NbS impacts as equitably as possible. The relevance of the proposed framework lies in several aspects: firstly, its emphasis on ICAs for NbS, offering a thorough and systematic insight into the environmental, social, and economic trade-offs and synergies associated with NbS; secondly, the pioneering methodological approach that merges cutting-edge methodologies with the consideration of stakeholders' perspectives, and thirdly, its ability to integrate context-specific analyses and its applicability in both the planning and monitoring phases of ICAs.

10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103979;Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have gained global attention for their transformative potential to simultaneously address biodiversity loss, climate change, and human well-being. However, there are concerns that dominant framings reinforce vested interests, marginalise alternative perspectives, and lead to persistent patterns of inequality and injustice. While participatory governance of NbS is widely acclaimed to support more equitable and ‘just’ outcomes, it is unclear to what extent the necessary changes can occur within dominant framings and approaches. To address this gap, this paper foregrounds the messy, contested, and discontinuous politics of sustainability transformations to explore how different framings influence the transformative potential of NbS. Drawing from interviews and a survey with NbS practitioners and policy makers in the UK, we critically unpack the interplay between techno-scientific and market-oriented approaches, risk and uncertainty, and participatory governance processes in shaping transformative NbS. Our findings demonstrate that, despite numerous efforts to rethink and reframe NbS, there remains a need to make space for different conceptualisations, practices, and alternative approaches to transformation. We suggest that this requires transcending dominant techno-market framings that demand certainty and control over sustainability outcomes, and caution against “democracy washing” through NbS that perpetuates superficial participation and unequal power relations. These debates indicate that transformational NbS will require an explicit recognition of these power inequalities and a commitment to cultivate and open up - rather than control and close down - alternative perspectives, pathways, and possibilities that foster justice and well-being for both humans and nature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103971;Working with people is inherent to Nature-Based Solutions (NbS). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions (NbS) requires interventions to work with and for society, acknowledging and integrating stakeholder views in all aspects of NbS in landscapes. However, existing guidance on NbS does not fully reflect all the insights and guidance available from an extensive literature on stakeholder engagement, empowerment, participation and related concepts. This paper provides guidance on achieving stakeholder engagement in NbS, by using the literature to analyse the role of stakeholder engagement in eight NbS criteria of the IUCN Global Standard. Each criterion represents themes orienting engagement, briefly: (1) societal challenges, (2) design at scale, (3) biodiversity net-gain, (4) economic feasibility, (5) inclusive governance, (6) balancing trade-off (7) adaptive management and (8) sustainability and mainstreaming. We show it is imperative to clearly differentiate stakeholders and their differing roles in different aspects of NbS. Hence, for each criterion there should be: a clearly defined rationale (why), the different stakeholder groups (who), the stage of the project (when) and the appropriate pathways (how) by which stakeholders will be engaged. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of the framework for those planning, resourcing and enabling nature-based solutions. We emphasise stakeholder engagement as multidimensional, requiring reflexibility and attention to inclusivity, equity and transparency. We also highlight the wicked problems of stakeholder engagement, in terms of the need for political support, resource commitment and competence to make engagement in NbS fit-for-purpose. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scs.2024.106037;Integration of Nature-based solution (NBS) as adaptation in planning and policy remains a challenge due to lack of adequate information on economic feasibility. This is mainly due to non-availability of economic evaluation framework for informed decision. Present study tries to address this by examining the status of evaluation frameworks through a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2023. Based on the synthesis of the evidence a five-step framework, exclusively for economic evaluation of NBS as urban adaptation has been developed. Using this a novel, holistic, just, equitable and inclusive cyclical decision tool has been proposed. The review confirmed the lack of economic assessment and a holistic evaluation framework. The evaluation framework has been backed by operational guidance by providing comprehensive recommendations on the methodologies, tools and techniques and indicators and metrics that can be used for execution of each step. The proposed cyclical decision tool facilitates equity and justice by having provisions for ensuring equal participation of each stakeholder in decision making. It specifically ensures incorporation of plurality of knowledge and in particular value of the ecosystem services (ESs) from NBS. The tool has applicability across the urban spatial scale in cities of developed and developing economies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2024.105561;"Preliminary evidence suggests that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups may derive greater health benefits from residential green space (RGS); however, the heterogeneity of the mechanisms underlying the health effects of RGS across socioeconomic status strata remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the association between RGS quantity and quality and subjective well-being (SWB) in older adults, and to unravel the variation in this association and its mechanisms based on housing price levels (as an SES proxy), using a sample of 439 older adults in Nanjing, China. Multivariate linear models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to evaluate the association between RGS and SWB and to examine their underlying pathways. Multi-group SEM analysis was employed to investigate the effect modification of SES on these pathways. We found that RGS was positively associated with SWB by promoting physical activity and social cohesion, and by reducing perceived air pollution and noise. Older adults in low-SES communities were more likely to benefit from RGS exposure. These variations could be partially explained by differences in physical activity and social cohesion, which were more pertinent for older adults in low-SES communities. Our findings have implications for green interventions aimed at achieving health equity in underdeveloped urban environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1111/btp.13369;Urban ecology and tropical biology have both developed rapidly in recent decades and matured into important interdisciplinary fields, with significant implications for biodiversity and human communities globally. However, urban ecosystems within the tropics remain understudied and poorly characterized despite these systems representing major hotspots for both biodiversity and human population growth. Here we review the state of the field of “tropical urban ecology.” We first evaluated and propose ecological hypotheses about how tropical versus extratropical species and ecosystems might differ from one another in how they respond to urbanization pressures. While data remain limited, we expect that tropical biodiversity should be at least as vulnerable to urbanization (and potentially more vulnerable) than extratropical biodiversity. We also examined the importance of ecosystem services in tropical cities and demonstrate the challenges in quantifying, managing, and sustaining these across diverse socioeconomic and environmental contexts. Finally, we propose an agenda for moving the field of tropical urban ecology forward through an interdisciplinary lens that synthesizes recent advances in both urban ecology and tropical biology. Specifically, advances and development in community science, Earth observation, environmental justice, One Health, and land sparing/sharing strategies could lead to major steps forward in the conservation of biodiversity in tropical cities. As the world urbanizes increasingly in biodiverse-rich tropical ecosystems, we must have strong conceptual frameworks and increased data/attention on both the ecological and human communities most impacted by these significant global changes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.pecon.2025.09.002;Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are increasingly recognized as key strategies for urban climate adaptation. To ensure effectiveness and avoid conceptual dilution, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) established a Global Standard comprising eight guiding criteria. However, the extent to which these criteria are incorporated into scientific research remains unclear. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of 79 peer-reviewed studies to evaluate how the IUCN criteria are applied in NbS literature focused on cities, and whether their inclusion relates to reported adaptation outcomes. Our results show that most studies emphasize biophysical aspects, such as temperature or runoff reduction, while largely overlooking social, institutional, and temporal dimensions. Criteria such as Governance, Trade-offs, and Adaptive management appear in less than 10% of the studies. We also find a negative association between the number of criteria considered and the mean effect size, with greater variability in outcomes as complexity increases. These findings suggest that while multidimensional integration is essential, it also poses implementation challenges. Bridging these gaps will require adaptive approaches that align ecological performance with governance, long-term monitoring, and social needs. Advancing NbS research through more comprehensive and standardized assessments is critical to ensure their credibility, equity, and long-term relevance in urban climate adaptation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/09654313.2025.2546938;Children and youth are increasingly recognized as a stakeholder group that needs to be involved in all planning processes affecting their living environments, such as urban playgrounds. Schoolyards and public playgrounds, as key spaces embedded in the everyday geographies of children, offer a promising site for child-friendly nature-based solutions to counter social and environmental challenges, including health challenges, urban heat stress, and lack of safety for outdoor play. However, greening a city inclusively with children is challenging, and only recently have most European cities begun to explore this. Here, we analyze planning processes for inclusive greening of urban playgrounds and schoolyards in two European cities, Barcelona (Spain) and Utrecht (the Netherlands). Results show inclusive planning with children is challenging due to planning traditions constraining participation, narrow views of non-experts on children’s contributions, and a limited understanding of children’s agency. In addition, we show that the type of planning affects inclusivity, flexibility, and distributive justice of these playgrounds. Exploring inclusive planning of playgrounds directs our attention to child-friendly urban planning, which goes beyond simply providing playgrounds. It is also about making schools and playgrounds part of the environmental and social transformation of cities and making children part of their planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1177/09562478251364221;Socio-technical assistance projects advancing the use of urban nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining currency in the global South, but many gaps exist in our understanding of how they can lead to more just outcomes. We examine the literature of informal settlement upgrading and climate adaptation in the global South to conceptualize contemporary socio-technical assistance projects using NbS. Building upon selected case studies in small island developing states (SIDS) in the Asia Pacific region, we draw lessons on how initiatives can address challenges such as power dynamics, limited funding and competing priorities. We examine these projects using justice as a lens that accounts for procedural, recognition and distributional dimensions. The findings reveal that, despite persistent barriers, there are mechanisms through which socio-technical assistance can contribute to justice in the implementation of NbS by creating new platforms for decision-making processes and relationships between residents, funders, local governments and academia. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-99132-5_14;Urban areas are increasingly exposed to the impacts of climate change, including extreme heat, flooding, and deteriorating air quality, all of which pose significant threats to public health and urban sustainability. Traditional infrastructure systems, often rigid and outdated, are ill-equipped to respond to these dynamic challenges. This chapter explores climate-resilient infrastructure strategies that enhance urban sustainability by integrating green infrastructure, adaptive urban planning, and public health considerations. Using a qualitative research approach, the study synthesis data from peer-reviewed literature, global policy frameworks, and comparative case studies of cities including Ahmedabad, Chennai, Rotterdam, New York, Singapore, and Copenhagen. The four core dimensions were identified: technological innovation, governance structures, health outcomes, and community participation. The results highlight that cities integrating nature-based solutions, such as permeable surfaces, green roofs, and urban forests, alongside early warning systems and adaptive water infrastructure, have significantly reduced health risks and improved resilience to climate-related stresses. However, challenges remain, especially in low- and middle-income cities, where financial, institutional, and policy constraints hinder large-scale implementation. The chapter argues that climate-resilient urban infrastructure must be inclusive, health-centred, and adaptable to varying urban contexts. It concludes by recommending mandatory health impact assessments, stronger policy integration, and community co-production in resilience planning. These strategies, if systematically adopted, can help urban areas not only withstand climate-related shocks but also enhance long-term well-being, equity, and sustainability for all residents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.crm.2025.100740;Environmental relocation presents a form of risk management that requires organized movement of communities but are complex to carry out and can have inequitable results. A careful examination of the ethical dimensions of relocation from planning to implementation to outcomes offers an avenue for understanding and addressing potential injustices. Using a deductive environmental justice framework, we analyzed two compensation-based relocations, also understood as buyouts: the 2013 Danube flood relocation in Austria's Eferding Basin and the Noordwaard de-poldering in the Netherlands’ Room for the River program. We combined document analysis (n = 62) and semi-structured interviews (n = 20) to assess justice concerns, focusing on distributive, procedural, and ecological dimensions. Distributive justice was primarily addressed through financial compensation, offering 100 % market value in the Noordwaard and 80 % in the Eferding Basin, but non-monetary considerations were relatively neglected. Procedural justice, particularly transparency and citizen participation, were insufficient. Considerations of ecological justice were absent in the Eferding Basin but the Noordwaard's use of nature-based solutions and prioritization of spatial quality led to multiple environmental benefits. Overall, this paper argues that justice should not be viewed simply as a criterion to be fulfilled, but rather as a guiding principle for addressing the broader, short and long-term impacts, and well-being related to relocation. By adopting this perspective, justice can be understood as an opportunity for positive transformation, allowing environmental relocation to be framed as a process with the potential for meaningful, beneficial change rather than solely a response to current or future flood risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.5130/ccs.v17.i2.9911;"Indigenous peoples have acted across a wide range of fields to address climate change. In all contexts they encounter the barriers of established colonial relations of land and state sovereignty. Indigenous-centred agendas are defined in articulation, with and against these dominant regimes. In this respect they are ‘immanent’, locked into in dialectical struggles for sovereignty. Such contestations are inherently generative: they force new issues onto the agenda, enabling transformation. In this special issue, transformative possibilities are discussed across the carbon cycle: at the point of extraction and emission; the application of mitigation and renewables; carbon sinks and ‘nature-based’ solutions; adaptation and conservation; and issues of governance and influence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/s11355-025-00677-2;As we enter an era of climate crisis response, ecosystems and human lifestyles are changing, creating a growing demand for solutions that balance ecological and social needs with budget constraints and land-use changes. Climate change impacts both ecosystems and human well-being, making the interaction between humans and ecosystems complex and unpredictable. This study analyzed the relationship between land use and land-cover connectivity and satisfaction/dissatisfaction with ecosystem services (ES) to understand the dynamics of these interactions. We introduced the concept of perceived landscape connectivity (PLC), which assesses landscape continuity, physical connectivity, and accessibility from a human perspective. Using the R package “landscapemetrics,” we analyzed PLC in 18 legal neighborhoods (Dong) in Seoul and examined its correlation with satisfaction/dissatisfaction regarding the socio-cultural value of ES. The results revealed that factors influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction with ES are distinct rather than opposing. Specifically, decreased aggregation of impermeable surfaces and increased access to water and green spaces boosted satisfaction with urban parks and health-related ES. Conversely, increased aggregation of impermeable surfaces and reduced boundary areas heightened dissatisfaction with biodiversity-based ES. In addition, reduced water-surface aggregation increased dissatisfaction with resilience-based ES, such as natural disaster prevention and heat control. This study highlights the significance of PLC in supporting decision-making processes that enhance ES satisfaction and reduce dissatisfaction, particularly through nature-based solutions (NBS) in urban environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.24057/2071-9388-2025-3691;The incorporation of nature-based solutions into urban planning and development policies has become a pressing issue in many large cities worldwide, aiming to improve the urban environment and the well-being of city-dwellers. However, the establishment and management of urban green infrastructure can be expensive and may lead to spatial injustice or be ecologically inefficient due to the planning decisions. This study focuses on the Spatial Justice-Ecological Efficiency Nexus of urban green infrastructure in large Caucasian cities of Russia, where urbanization rates are rapidly increasing. The hypothesis of this study is that green infrastructure in Russian cities predominantly has an ecological aspect, meaning that it provides a large volume of ecosystem services that are still unavailable to a significant portion of the urban population. To explore this topic, we aim to assess the balance between the social and ecological aspects of green infrastructure in six case study cities, including Makhachkala, Grozny, Nalchik, Maykop, Vladikavkaz, and Stavropol. The assessment framework includes 12 indicators, divided into two categories: spatial justice (6 indicators) and ecological efficiency (6 indicators). The spatial justice indicators assess the availability, accessibility, and distribution of green infrastructure, while the ecological efficiency indicators evaluate the performance of regulating and supporting ecosystem services. The results revealed that despite the common prevalence of ecological side in large Russian cities, the spatial justice side in the southern cities generally dominates over the ecological side, with most cities having an unbalanced nexus. Green infrastructure in the studied cities has a low ecological input, with a mean total score of around 300 points (out of 600), with most cities lacking protected areas and green areas beyond the edge effect. Meanwhile, the social side of the nexus is more developed, with an average score of 400. The study highlights the need for a more integrated approach to urban green infrastructure planning, considering both justice and ecological aspects to ensure a more just and sustainable urban environment. Overall, in this research we introduce a multidimensional approach to understanding the functions and qualities of green infrastructure that will allow for a more comprehensive assessment and planning of the rapidly growing southern cities. This study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between urban green infrastructure spatial justice and ecological efficiency, providing valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders seeking to create more sustainable and equitable urban environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/frwa.2025.1563873;Introduction: Climate variability and socio-environmental challenges are often assessed separately, overlooking their interdependencies. This siloed management approach may mitigate one issue while inadvertently intensifying others. The Water, Energy, Food, and Ecosystem (WEFE) nexus approach provides, however, a holistic framework for understanding these interconnected systems and promoting sustainable resource management with particular attention to gender mainstreaming and social inequality. Methodology: This paper establishes, consequently, a baseline study for applying the WEFE nexus transition scheme in the Matmata region, a semi-arid area characterized by an important rural exodus, limited water resources, and monoculture agrosystems. Using a participatory, community-driven approach, data were collected during field surveys, face-to-face meetings, multi-stakeholder dialogue, the Delphi method, focus group discussions, and the nominal group technique. Qualitative data were statistically treated using inter-rater coding. Findings highlight sociocultural barriers as a major constraint to women's effective participation in the Nexus Ecosystem Laboratory (NEL) of Matmata. Economic dependency stemming from family agricultural unpaid work restricts their inclusion in the decision-making process and ownership rights. Their growing awareness of nature-based solutions and motivation to initiate micro-projects that valorize local natural and cultural assets align with the nexus transition schemes. Results and discussion: Promoting institutional arrangements and enhancing gender inclusion are pivotal for driving systemic transformation. The research emphasizes that fostering gender equity is integral to economic sustainability. The successful shift toward the WEFE nexus governance approach must incorporate overlooked social dimensions and invest in community-based strategies, expanding the nexus toolkits for a flexible and adaptive approach. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-88777-2_14;This chapter explores the complex relationship between climate change, ocean conservation, and human rights, emphasizing the ocean’s role as Earth’s life support system and a critical component of global sustainability. It highlights the ecological, economic and cultural significance of the ocean while examining some of the many threats it faces from climate change, including warming, acidification, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation. The chapter demonstrates how these environmental challenges directly and indirectly impact fundamental human rights, such as access to food, water, and a healthy environment. The discussion is framed around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 13 (Climate Change) and SDG 14SDG 14 (Life below water), showcasing their interdependence and their importance in addressing global challenges. International agreements are addressed as pivotal mechanisms for fostering sustainable ocean governance. Furthermore, the chapter advocates for the integration of blue economy strategies, nature-based solutions, and ecosystem restoration as pathways to mitigate climate impacts while ensuring economic growth and social equity. In conclusion, this chapter calls to the urgency of collaborative and integrated global efforts to address the climate-ocean-human rights nexus. It is possible to secure the future health of the ocean while advancing human well-being and environmental justice by promoting sustainable management practices, innovative policies, and inclusive governance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/13552074.2025.2471223;This essay draws from a larger study that explores gender and social inclusion in small-scale aquaculture in Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, using a feminist political ecology (FPE) lens. Through qualitative research, we examine how fish farmers’ embodied experiences reveal the intersections of labour, emotional well-being, and food security within broader socioeconomic and environmental challenges. Hydropower development, particularly the Pak Mun and Lam Dom dams, has disrupted traditional fisheries, forcing small-scale farmers to adapt amid declining fish stocks, unpredictable flooding, and market volatility. The contributions of small-scale fish farmers, especially women, remain undervalued as they juggle aquaculture, agriculture, and household responsibilities while facing structural barriers to expanding their farms. Climate change further exacerbates these vulnerabilities, with extreme droughts and floods destabilising livelihoods. The study highlights how fish farmers experience uncertainty and displacement not only as economic hardships but as deeply embodied realities affecting emotional and physical well-being. Recognising these lived experiences is crucial for designing nature-based solutions in aquaculture that account for both ecological sustainability and social justice. By centring the voices of marginalised fish farmers, particularly women, we argue for policy approaches that integrate emotional and material dimensions of labour to create more life-enhancing aquaculture systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fmars.2025.1483428;"Coastal communities around the world are facing increasingly severe climate change impacts that threaten their current and future livability. To address these impacts, coastal climate adaptation projects have taken various approaches to decreasing climate vulnerability through nature-based solutions and hard infrastructure centered around minimizing stormwater flooding, coastal erosion, and sea-level rise; as well as coastal retreat programs for when vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated. While these adaptation projects are important in addressing current climate impacts, many adaptation projects run the risk of exacerbating pre-existing social inequalities and/or creating new ones. We surveyed current coastal climate adaptation projects in Canada, which include a mix of nature-based, hard infrastructure, relocation, and hybrid projects, and performed a literature review to assess adaptation projects’ potential social equity risks based on the information available. We find that all adaptation plans have the potential of generating equity risks, with different kinds of interventions potentially generating different risks, such as redirecting climate impacts to other communities, displacing communities, and promoting development in risky areas. Adaptation projects are more likely to experience maladaptive social outcomes when they are planned and implemented by people removed from the impacted communities, as this removal often creates oversights in exactly who and how people will be impacted. Maladaptive outcomes may also be the result of processing and funding limitations. Conversely, we found that there are important mediating steps that can limit or avoid maladaptive outcomes, most importantly inclusive planning processes where marginalized groups are involved in decision-making. We argue that this risk-based approach to purposely outline potential maladaptive outcomes are important to assess how adaptation projects may perpetuate the historical marginalization, dispossession, and displacement of marginalized communities. If potential risks can be outlined in advance, there are opportunities for planning processes to mitigate and avoid these risks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1088/1755-1315/1479/1/012058;The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami affected Indonesia with massive devastation and suffering. It ignited the largest international humanitarian response and recovery in history. Academicians, responders, civil servants, teachers, and all professions were awakened to the urgency of disaster risk reduction, mitigation, preparedness, and readiness. Indonesia then instituted disaster management law, established national, provincial, and local disaster management organizations, and started developing a disaster management workforce. The United States of America (USA) supported Indonesia's 2004 tsunami response and recovery and continues to assist in capabilities enhancement. This research aims to explore how knowledge exchange through training, education, policy improvement, system development, and organizational management contributes to the whole society's capacity. Our method includes a literature review, focus group discussions, and site visits to explore collaborations between governments, private sectors, civil societies, non-governmental organizations, and regular citizens to generate improved disaster preparedness and readiness. Recent US-Indonesia comparative study missions offer lessons and recommendations for urban planning and green infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and readiness progression. Major findings through comparative lessons gained include the importance of developing incident management assistance team, supplemental response team, community emergency response team, regional office, biochemical hazard training, national interagency fire management, hazard and social vulnerability risk mapping, and incident workforce academy. New knowledge enrichment brings excitement and expectations, requiring competent human resource, financial, and policy investments. Capacity building must increase equity and resilience planning for vulnerable communities across the islands as Indonesia increases its regional disaster response contribution. Future implications would include prioritized efforts for short, medium, and long-term transformation in improving disaster management in Indonesia and continuing to collaborate with the USA in nurturing sustainability and resilience despite complex challenges in disaster risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/13504509.2024.2424988;In densely populated cities, people confront multiple impacts of climate change, including stormwater runoff, flooding, heat waves, and health issues. To address these impacts, nature-based solutions (NbS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to contribute to sustainability, resilience, and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, more research is required to understand the wider potential of NbS and to identify priority areas for their deployment. This study developed an analytical approach and implemented it in the Tehran Metropolitan Area (TMA) by considering factors related to NbS co-benefits. The approach included spatial prioritization, spatial correlation analysis, and suitability analysis. It combines a Geographic Information System, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, Zonation, Best-Worst Method, Bivariate Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation analysis (BiLISA), a Fuzzy Inference System, and Boolean overlay analysis. The results include maps showing priority areas for different types of NbS and spatial co-benefits and mismatches. High-priority areas are located in disadvantaged areas. In total, 105.73 km2 (17% of the TMA) was designated as highly prioritized. We show that various NbS interventions are applicable, with green roofs and rainwater harvesting being the most feasible. This study can assist decision-makers in optimizing NbS to deliver maximum co-benefits. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/13504509.2025.2456862;Achieving just and equitable access to urban ecosystem services is crucial for promoting sustainable urban development. However, recent literature highlights significant challenges in achieving such accessibility, often without comprehensively examining the underlying causes. In response, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the barriers that limit just and equitable access to ecosystem services and offering actionable solutions to create more inclusive and resilient urban environments. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 115 studies, employing both deductive and inductive approaches. Our findings show that cultural ecosystem services (45%) are the most inaccessible compared to other ecosystem services, explicitly limiting urban residents’ opportunities for recreation, social integration, and the development of place identity. We also identified four key barriers contributing to this inaccessibility: legacy, social, geographical, and institutional factors. Among these, social barriers (32%) appeared as the most significant, driven by societal norms and cultural differences. Furthermore, a clear divide is observed between the Global North and South: social barriers are more prominent in the North due to societal variations, while institutional barriers dominate in the South, reflecting weaker governance capacities. In response to these challenges, we highlight several key solutions. Inclusive urban planning (36%) stands out as the primary strategy, followed by improvements in governance and legacy considerations (27%) to address accessibility issues. These findings offer a valuable foundation to develop resilient urban policies and community-centered solutions, supporting the achievement of SDGs 11 and 13. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scs.2024.105956;Despite efforts to mitigate climate change by promoting active travel, limited research has focused on climate adaptation for active transportation (CAAT) initiatives. To address this gap, we conducted a qualitative study based on interviews with 30 planning professionals to uncover what CAAT projects U.S. cities are implementing, their barriers, and their facilitators. We found that U.S. cities are increasingly implementing CAAT projects such as street trees and green stormwater infrastructure to address threats like extreme heat and pluvial flooding. Importantly, CAAT projects require collaborations between city departments (e.g., transportation and forestry). We also identified a complex network of barriers and facilitators shaping CAAT project implementation. Funding, politics, laws, and cross-department collaborations can be barriers and facilitators, and supportive (or unsupportive) politics and laws are strongly connected. Additionally, underserved communities face unique barriers to implementing CAAT projects, but recent facilitators such as dedicated funding have contributed to equitable investment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100137;The project Feral Hues and Invasive Pigments (FH&IP) addresses the role of spontaneous urban plants (aka weeds) through ecosocial art, with the goal of reducing human alienation from plant life and land in urban and disturbed habitats. Hands-on work with spontaneous urban plants through ecosocial artistic methods—like walks, workshops, and land-based sculptures—provides cues for understanding weedy plants and informal greenspace (IGS) as part of nature-based solutions (NBS) in cities. In dialog with NBS research that takes a justice-oriented, degrowth approach to urban greenspace, the FH&IP project invites hands-on, hyperlocal participation of humans and plants at the neighborhood level to enhance the role of low maintenance IGS. Bringing ecosocial artistic methods into conversation with NBS research is one way to open up knowledge practices that inform both fields. Multisensorial, direct engagement with urban-dwelling plants can help practitioners and participants understand what kinds of maintenance and tending might help improve sentiment around spontaneous urban vegetation and improve its functional benefits for human communities. In the right context, such benefits range from flood mitigation to improved mental health to cooler, cleaner air. A “ladder of engagement” for reciprocal exchange with spontaneous urban plants is proposed to trace how the ecosocial artistic methods employed in FH&IP build plant-human solidarity towards more functional NBS in IGS. Methods like gallery installations, workshops, and walks are described and analyzed for their strengths and weaknesses in accessibility and depth, qualities that help initiate engagement and move participants up the ladder. At the lowest rung of the ladder, participants ignore or actively harm spontaneous urban plants, then move to noticing, tending, and eventually advocating for plants and the land they dwell on. The shift from alienation to advocacy has potential to improve the function of IGS by amplifying and enhancing contextually appropriate NBS that respect local needs and desires while improving equitable distribution of bioculturally diverse greenspace. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100196;This study performs an economic efficiency and equity analysis of four recent Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) interventions in Haiti, India, Indonesia, and Uganda. Our analysis aims at contributing to the development of methodological best practices for assessing both the economic-effectiveness and the distributional impacts of nature-based solutions, with a particular focus on marginalized or underserved communities. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are emerging as possible strategies to mitigate disaster risk while providing additional benefits to biodiversity and sustainable economic growth. However, there is limited scientific evidence about the cost-effectiveness and equity outcomes of NbS. For each ecosystem-based intervention examined we performed an economic efficiency assessment through a quantitative cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Our estimates show that at the 5th year since the project implementation, the interventions in Haiti and India generated positive net benefits, assuming hazard-related yearly losses in properties and GDP per capita in the project areas as low as 0.5 %. We observe the same outcomes in Indonesia and Uganda at the 10th year since the project implementation, assuming yearly losses equivalent to 1 % or higher and adopting a 3 % discount rate. When we include additional benefits from carbon capture and sequestration and pollution reduction the CBA net benefits estimates are positive at the 10th year mark for every discount rate adopted. Extensive qualitative interviews of local stakeholders corroborate the CBA results and provide insights on the numerous additional benefits experienced, which in the future could be measured and monetized if monitored over time. A qualitative analysis of the distributional effects of the interventions was performed to complement the economic efficiency assessment. This equity analysis indicates an enhancement in inclusivity, economic equality, participation, and capacity building among local stakeholders. In particular, the Eco-DRR interventions implemented resulted in significant education, health, safety and economic improvements for women, children, and economically vulnerable members of the local communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100136;Ecofeminist artist and landscape designer Betsy Damon advocates for Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as more effective, resilient, and economical alternatives to conventional infrastructure projects that try to impose human control over natural systems. NBS embraces nature's self-sustaining tendencies by harnessing natural processes to address environmental challenges. Damon examines case studies of NBS from her own career, including her 1998 Living Water Garden, a water-cleaning park in Chengdu, China. Damon also draws lessons from the reforestation of the Loess Plateau, the Indigenous-led restoration of Washington's Elwha River, and the revival of amaranth cultivation in Central Mexico. These cases reveal key principles behind effective NBS engagements: flexibility, complexity, interconnectedness, and memory. Meanwhile, projects that impose single-purpose design often degrade surrounding ecosystems. Damon critiques the common scientific approach of understanding systems only through isolating variables, arguing that isolated thinking leads to isolated design. She advocates for a shift towards radical interconnectedness. She concludes that because NBS don't place human systems and natural systems into separate, conflicting categories, they strengthen resilience on multiple levels. Damon envisions NBS as inextricable from quality of life, climate justice, and Indigenous sovereignty. Throughout, Damon examines water as the medium of nature's flexibility and resilience, from the ecosystem to the molecular level. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100134;"This paper presents the term Ecoartivism, for a novel nature-based strategy to address ecocide. Ecoartivism evolved from my ecoart practice, which sought pragmatic answers to chaotic environmental conditions. I advocate for how Ecoartivism draws from many influences to embrace a more intuitive but sustainable relationship between art, science, and law based on our values. I will track how my practice began layering basic aesthetic skills with science to restore degraded ecosystems, (Ghost Nets and Blue Rocks 1990–2005); inspired an original premise, trigger point theory, that small points of deliberate intervention can effect systemic change; and led to an Ecoartivist symphony and then an opera, (Blued Trees (2015 - present). My thinking has felt informed by Traditional Environmental Knowledge (TEK) and what some Indigenous communities term reciprocity, the idea that humans must live with mutual respect and as part of an inclusive vision of nature. Blued Trees developed a novel legal theory about ownership and what we choose to value. That redefinition led to Ecoartivism as a nature-based solution to sustainability. GPS located sentinel trees were identified as tree-notes in an aerial score composed of 1/3-mile increments across North America in forested corridors where natural gas pipeline installations were proposed. In a 2018 mock trial an injunction was handed down in favor of protecting the Blued Trees project on the basis of standing (a legal term establishing formal rights for due consideration in a court trial). I will explain how trigger point theory could support legal standing for Earth rights and ecosystem resilience. Blued Trees continues as an opera-in-progress to expand and deepen arguments for making ecocide accountable with serious penalties at the International Court of Justice at the Hague. This discussion will illustrate how ecoartivist strategies may support habitat contiguity, inspire and drive novel nature-based solutions to ecocide, deepening partnerships with scientists who can test and build on provocative insight. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100184;This paper advocates including and comprehending multicultural values for cultural ecosystem services (CES) in environmental planning metrics. CES can provide metrics for assessing the effectiveness of environmental planning. Environmental planning metrics sometimes adopt models that do not fairly incorporate perspectives from historically excluded ethnic groups. Including multicultural ecological values can improve the quality of policies that seek to conserve and preserve the biophysical environment. This paper proposes an unfolding framework for reimagining ecosystem-based adaptations, a nature-based solution that overlaps ideas of socioecological benefits through cultural ecosystem services. In addition, the authors offer examples of including missing cultural values in environmental planning, drawing on a review of ecosystem-based adaptations and frameworks of reimagination. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100148;Nature-based solutions (NBS) have emerged as crucial and promising interventions to realize resilient, sustainable, and climate-adaptive cities. One key approach is integrating them into real estate development. While real estate-related NBS – like green roofs, walls, car parks and pocket parks – are applauded for their benefits in terms of quality of life and real estate value, they are also at the core of justice concerns. If left unaddressed, NBS can lead to green gentrification and spark a wider justice discussion on distributional, procedural, recognition, and ecological justice. In this paper, we explore how to shift from a ‘win-lose’ to a ‘just’ implementation of NBS in real estate, by collecting qualitative data from Dutch real estate and NBS practitioners on projects that aimed for NBS integration into real estate while attending to (dimensions of) justice. We identify fifteen enablers that support ‘just’ real estate-related NBS, clustered under four themes (government support, knowledge, community engagement and organizational management). Based on these findings, we propose managerial implications for ‘just’ NBS integration in real estate and avenues for further NBS research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su162410794;"Urbanization increases the number of impervious surfaces in watersheds, reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration, which increases runoff volumes and the risks of flooding and the pollution of water resources. Nature-based solutions (NBS) mitigate these effects by managing water volume and quality, restoring the hydrological cycle, and creating sustainable livelihoods that can promote socioeconomic equity by providing green space. In light of the aforementioned information, this study analyzes the hydrological response of NBS in La Guapil, a densely populated and socioeconomically vulnerable area of Costa Rica with approximately 80% impervious surfaces, focusing on their effectiveness in stormwater management and improving hydrological conditions. Field data from the study area’s storm drainage system, as well as hydrological analyses, were collected and processed to evaluate RCP8.5 climate change scenarios using the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relationship. Three scenarios were proposed: (1) the “status quo”, reflecting current conditions, (2) green roofs and green improvements, and (3) detention ponds and green improvements, evaluated using the SWMM, with the latter scenario also using the Iber model. Simulations showed that Scenario 2 achieved the greatest reduction in peak flow (53.74%) and runoff volume (57.60%) compared to Scenario 3 (peak: 28.37%; volume: 56.42%). Both scenarios demonstrate resilience to climate change projections. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into NBS in Costa Rica and other comparable regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128525;Urban nature-based solutions (NBS) are increasingly embraced by academics and practitioners for their ability to contribute to sustainability by addressing various urban challenges such as air quality, urban heat stress, urban flood mitigation, biodiversity loss, and social cohesion. Research in the literature places a significant focus on the identification of synergies and win-win scenarios of urban NBS. However, this has caused a blind spot in necessary research on trade-offs. Specifically, the existing research on trade-offs lacks a holistic overview of empirical evidence on urban NBS trade-offs from diverse fields of research, and current discussions on trade-offs inadequately reflect on the political nature of the choices and consequences of trade-offs when planning and governing for and with urban NBS. This paper addresses these issues by providing an overarching typology of urban NBS related trade-offs and the environmental justice implications thereof through a scoping literature review of empirical research on urban NBS trade-offs from different fields of research. The review provides an overview of the variable understandings of trade-offs of NBS, the usage of spatial and temporal scales when addressing them, and categorizes trade-offs according to stages of the planning cycle. We identify three main groups of urban NBS trade-offs, namely, rigid, governance, and functional trade-offs, and illustrate their different manifestations across the planning cycle. The typology sheds new light on research of urban NBS trade-offs by explicitly placing an environmental justice perspective on the types of trade-offs, and linking these types with the planning cycle. Thereby, this paper contributes to a new understanding of urban NBS trade-offs for planning and governance by illuminating the implications of choices for who or what is recognized, participates, and benefits from nature in the city. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecoser.2024.101677;Environmental justice considerations in ecosystem service research have increased in recent years, especially in urban assessments. Many studies have focused on the unequal distribution of urban green infrastructure and related ecosystem services from a residential perspective. However, for certain population groups, such as children, considering other frequently visited urban settings (e.g. school environments) is also essential to assess distributive environmental justice. While there is an increasing number of studies measuring children's access and exposure to green infrastructure in school environments, most of these assessments rely on coarse metrics of greenness (e.g. NDVI). In this research, we propose a multi-indicator distributive justice approach to assess schools’ outdoor environmental quality. More specifically, our study examines the spatial distribution of nine school-related socio-environmental indicators, including green infrastructure elements (n = 3), regulating ecosystem services (n = 2), environmental hazards (n = 2), and socio-economic background (n = 2) for nearly all primary school settings (n = 408) located in the Brussels Capital Region, Belgium. Bivariate and spatial regression analyses show that schoolchildren from wealthier families usually attend schools with greener and better outdoor environmental quality, generally characterized by more vegetation in and around the school settings, higher levels of regulating ecosystem services provision, and lower exposure to environmental hazards. We argue that addressing these multi-faceted environmental disparities should be prioritized when planning new school greening initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.futures.2024.103480;Climate change is projected to heighten flood risk. To adapt to this higher flood risk, catchment-wide flood risk management (FRM) plans have become increasingly popular. These plans aim to implement risk reduction measures (RRMs), usually in rural areas on privately owned land, with the goal of reducing the vulnerability of downstream/urban regions. These interventions can have ramifications for rural/upstream areas as they restrict such areas’ spatial and economic growth. Despite these unequal outcomes of distributive justice, reasons for using the countryside/upstream areas are multifaceted, such as lowering the costs of implementation or attaining further co-benefits. In this paper, we aim to analyse how anticipated futures are used to legitimise the unequal distributive consequences of catchment-wide FRM. We combine insights from future studies involving a future perspective (expected, preferable, and probable futures) and the distributive justice literature to examine the debate on large-scale catchment-wide FRM plans in Austria and the Netherlands. In both countries, the debates remain rather implicit, even though the subsequent decisions can have substantial repercussions for the distribution of burdens and benefits. Whereas in the Netherlands expected futures are contested, in Austria desired justice implications are contested between authorities and locals. On the one hand, futures are harnessed by quanitifying desired futures and by embedding expected futures in decision-making tools. On the other hand, credibility of expected futures is descreased by framing them as more uncertain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2024.105474;Cities in the world are experiencing increases in the severity of extreme weather events, leading to significant threats for urban dwellers. Ensuring an equitable implementation of risk reduction interventions requires considering the uneven distributions of risk. However, adaptation planning often fails to adequately consider the distributional injustices of risk, potentially reproducing spatial inequalities. Current forms of engagement hinder the effective contribution of local stakeholders to the development of risk assessments for the design of interventions. Here, we present a co-production process in which place-based advocacy organizations and healthcare practitioners actively participate in the identification of flooding exposure and vulnerability priority areas. The process is applied in Milwaukee, WI, where we developed the Milwaukee Flood-Health Vulnerability Assessment (FHVA) to identify priority areas for implementing stormwater management strategies including nature-based solutions such as urban green infrastructure. We discuss the process underpinning the analysis and the development of dissemination tools that enable advocacy organizations, urban planners, and policy makers to make use of the FHVA. We find co-production to be a critical component of making vulnerability and exposure analyses useful both for policy makers and stakeholders in need of usable scientific information to support advocacy on equitable adaptation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s12237-024-01425-9;Most living shoreline site selection and design decision support tools are based upon existing environmental conditions. We developed a web-based, geospatial tool called Future Shorelines that integrates high-resolution landscape elevation data and a matrix of locally derived NOAA Interagency Sea Level Rise Scenarios to characterize future conditions of submergence and shoreline translation induced by sea level rise. Once the practitioner selects a location of interest, sea level rise scenario (e.g., high), and target year (e.g., 2050), the tool will generate plan view and cross-sectional informational graphics specific to their choices. This information can then be paired with other menu options, like parcel ownership, to facilitate the planning and construction of nature-based shoreline stabilization solutions that (1) are located where opportunities for horizontal migration are optimized, (2) remain accessible for monitoring and maintenance, and (3) perform as intended over the design life of the installation. The tool’s menu options and the user interface were informed by project partner input solicited during numerous workshops convened over the duration of the 2-year project. This coproduction created a product that was familiar to the end user and therefore increased the likelihood that it would be utilized by them during the planning and design of living shoreline projects. Although developed for use in the Indian River Lagoon, located along the east-central Florida coast, it can be seamlessly replicated for application in other coastal regions of the USA where the requisite data are available. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s11252-024-01571-9;While urban river restoration has become mainstream in the Global North, it remains scarce in Latin America, where most literature focuses on water quality, stream habitats, and watershed assessment, but planning and implementation lag behind. Colombia is undergoing a paradigm shift after pioneering the integration of green and blue infrastructure (GBI) into urban planning in the early 2000s (namely Estructura Ecológica Principal). A surge in river renaturalization initiatives is underway, with large and intermediate cities planning and executing projects. We systematically assessed the integration of rivers and GBI into local policies (Planes de Ordenamiento Territorial) and found widespread and strong recognition of streams, wetlands, and ecosystem services in urban planning, higher than previously reported. Most cities emphasize river multifunctionality, ecological connectivity, public space, and recreation, as well as disaster risk reduction, advancing toward sustainable urban water and drainage systems. However, significant gaps persist regarding climate change resilience, participation, and social justice. In a region marked by high inequality, pre-existing spatial exclusion could be amplified by urban renewal, greening, and tourism due to unfair resettlement conditions and gentrification. Such trade-offs can undermine the ecological and social benefits of restoration. We highlight the crucial role of civil society and grassroots activism in protecting and defending urban commons and conclude by recommending a critical examination of GBI and river restoration efforts in Latin America. Colombia’s case can serve as both a reference and a cautionary tale for other cities in the region to achieve outcomes that promote equity and justice amid pressing social and environmental challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1097/EE9.0000000000000353;Environmental epidemiologists are increasingly evaluating whether and how human exposure to vegetation (greenspace) can benefit health. Relatedly, scientists and policymakers have highlighted the need to integrate efforts to address the dual crises of accelerating climate change and rapid loss of biodiversity, including nature-based solutions. Greenspace is one solution that can protect humans from climate-related exposures, including heat, air pollution, and flooding. However, most environmental epidemiology research on greenspace occurs in high-income countries, and adverse birth outcomes, previously associated with greenspace, disproportionately occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although epidemiology research using existing survey or administrative data and satellite imagery is important for documenting broad patterns, such research is lacking in LMICs. Further, complementary, community-engaged research to inform interventions and policies is needed so that nature-based solutions with co-benefits for climate mitigation and health are adopted effectively and equitably. We provide suggestions for future research that would increase impact and call for better representation of LMICs and vulnerable communities within high-income countries in research and action on greenspace and climate-sensitive birth outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su16229675;This paper reviews, compares, and critically evaluates two broad groups of sustainable agriculture models: “sustainable agriculture” and “sustainable agrifood systems”. The “sustainable agriculture” models—comprising organic farming, regenerative agriculture, climate-smart agriculture, carbon-capture agriculture, and nature-based solutions—focus primarily on improving ecological sustainability through farm-level practices. These models emphasize reducing external, industrial inputs, enhancing biodiversity, and promoting climate resilience, relying on technological and market-based solutions to address environmental concerns. On the other hand, the “sustainable agrifood systems” models—agroecology, alternative food networks, and permaculture—offer more ambitious visions of systemic transformation. These approaches not only seek to implement environmentally sound practices but also aim to reconfigure the broader food system by challenging corporate power, promoting local governance, fostering food sovereignty, and prioritizing social justice. Grounded in grassroots movements, these models emphasize social justice and economic viability in addition to ecological sustainability. This paper’s contribution lies in its comparative analysis of the wide array of sustainable alternatives, highlighting both their strengths and limitations. Adopting an agrarian political economy perspective, it critiques the former camp for limited engagement with structural issues inherent in capitalist agriculture and the latter camp for underplaying the importance of industrial agriculture for national development in the Global South. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scs.2024.105767;Green infrastructure provides multifarious benefits, improving urban resilience and sustainability amid increasing climate change and urbanization. Traditional green infrastructure planning studies were based on the spatial-equity principle, which usually neglected residents’ aggregation pattern, leading to the conflict with equitable green exposure. Using the sponge city of Zhengzhou as a case, this study proposes a novel priority ranking strategy, namely accessibility equity. We first spatially quantified the regional socioecological conditions on 0.25 km2 grids as green infrastructure planning drivers, including stormwater management, urban thermal environment, air quality, habitat maintenance and water purification. Subsequently we integrated these planning drivers with population density to conduct spatial autocorrelation analysis, priority ranking, and grid clustering. While most planning drivers are positively correlated with population density, except air quality, some areas show opposite trends in terms of local perspective, suggesting that the spatial equity may lead to mismatch between residents’ demand and GI priority. The priority order based on accessibility equity, rises in the city center and falls in suburbs and industrial zones. The study area is divided into four categories using k-means clustering, and we propose the corresponding adaptive green infrastructure development strategy. The framework can be a practical tool for guiding green infrastructure and sponge city projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1002/wat2.1750;Nature-based solutions (NbS, and related concepts like natural infrastructure, Ecosystem-based Adaptation, and green infrastructure) are increasingly recognized as multi-benefit strategies for addressing the critical sustainability challenges of the Anthropocene, including the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis. Mainstreaming NbS in professional practice requires strategic, landscape-level planning integrating multiple sources of benefits and their synergies and trade-offs. Levee setbacks (LS) are among the best-studied riverine NbS with recognized benefits for flood risk management, drought resilience, water quality management, recreational opportunities, and ecological restoration for biodiversity. Although awareness of the multifarious benefits of LS as forms of Natural Capital is growing, implementation remains ad-hoc and opportunistic. To address this critical implementation gap for one major example of NbS, we review and synthesize literature across diverse disciplines to provide an overview of the primary social, economic, and ecological mechanisms that affect the co-benefit delivery of LS projects. Next, to make this information relevant to NbS practitioners, we link these mechanisms to spatial metrics that can be used to approximate the relative magnitude of project benefits and costs across these mechanisms. Finally, we highlight examples of key synergies and trade-offs among benefits that should be considered for LS planning. This synthetic approach is intended to familiarize readers with the diverse potential benefits of LS, and provide an understanding of how to select and prioritize potential sites for further study and implementation. Synergies and trade-offs among important benefit drivers abound, and social equity concerns will be paramount in ensuring the successful implementation of LS and other NbS in the future.

10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174524;The potential of ecosystem-based interventions, also known as Nature-based Solutions (NbS), for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is now recognized by major national policies and international framework agreements. However, there is limited scientific evidence about their economic viability and equity impacts. We examined English-language peer-reviewed studies, published between 2000 and 2021, which undertook economic evaluations of NbS for DRR and CCA. Based on our results, 71 % of studies indicated that NbS have consistently proven to be a cost-effective approach to mitigating hazards and 24 % of studies found NbS cost-effective under certain conditions. The ecosystem-based interventions most frequently found effective in mitigating hazards are associated with mangroves (80 %), forests (77 %), and coastal ecosystems (73 %). Studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of NbS and engineering-based solutions for mitigating certain hazards showed that NbS are no less effective than engineering-based solutions. Among these studies, 65 % found that NbS are always more effective in attenuating hazards compared to engineering-based solutions and 26 % found that NbS are partially more effective. Our findings illustrate a range of factors, including the geographic locations of the NbS analyzed, their contribution to the restoration and increase of biodiversity, their property rights structure, their source of financing, and the economic methodologies employed to assess cost-effectiveness and distributional effects. The geographic location of the NbS observations included in this analysis was examined considering global projected temperature and precipitation changes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1017/sus.2024.24;"Non-technical summary Substantive carbon is sequestered in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass, and other marine ecosystems. Blue carbon is considered to offer potential for enhanced carbon sequestration. Bringing blue carbon to market, however, presents risks to local people and communities with livelihood and other connections to these environments. While efforts are forged to establish payments for ecosystem services, blue carbon presents critical challenges to social and environmental justice. In this paper, we synthesize insights from relevant literature and provide direction for future research on the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon. Technical summary Blue carbon has been proposed as a nature-based solution to mitigate climate change and is the focus of concerted scientific and policy attention. The rush to operationalize blue carbon however, presents significant risks for social and environmental justice where it intersects with inequality and marginalization. To date, the reasonable and just consequences of the social transformation that will accompany blue carbon are under-examined. We undertake a structured literature review of research published over the past decade that addresses the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon, and chart four themes: (1) conceptual issues, (2) governance issues; (3) emergent lessons (from practice); and (4) future research directions that address: social acceptability; processes to address social justice including engagement, participation, and benefit sharing; information and data deficits; and institutional governance reform. If the stated opportunities are to be fully realized, we argue the social and cultural dimensions of blue carbon, and its intersections with social justice, must be attended to explicitly and clarified. Social media summary Just transitions to climate change mean attending to people, culture, and livelihoods as blue carbon is operationalized. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3390/land13091531;Many cities are looking to adopt nature-based solutions (NBS) in greenspace to manage urban flooding and provide diverse co-benefits. Yet little research exists to inform the planning and design of park NBS. This study investigated NBS adoption in 58 public parks across major U.S. cities, using a 2022 survey by the Trust for Public Lands and other secondary datasets. We developed a typology to conceptualize a wide range of park NBS into five high-level categories by size/capacity, location of the gray–green spectrum, and design objectives. We then employed this typology to explore how a park’s adopted NBS types may relate to its landscape and sociodemographic contexts. We found that the most used type of NBS in the studied parks was ECO (a typology we defined as conserving, restoring, or creating ecosystems to mitigate flooding through ecological processes and functions), while the least used NBS type was ENG (a typology we defined as imitating natural infiltration processes but having no living elements). Further, parks that adopted ECO had significantly higher percentages of greenspace in the surrounding, as well as higher flood risks. We also found notable—though not statistically significant—evidence of potential associations between the type of NBS implementation in a park and its nearby neighborhoods’ income level, poverty, and population racial and age compositions. Moreover, our findings indicated that park visitors were more privileged compared to residents living near a park. We concluded that park contextual factors deserve more explicit consideration in the planning and design of NBS and discussed key implications of this study for practice and future research around park NBS for urban flooding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/horticulturae10090951;Water is crucial for enduring horticultural productivity, but high water-use requirements and declining water supplies with the changing climate challenge economic viability, environmental sustainability, and social justice. While the scholarly literature pertaining to water management in horticulture abounds, knowledge of practices and technologies that optimize water use is scarce. Here, we review the scientific literature relating to water requirements for horticulture crops, impacts on water resources, and opportunities for improving water- and transpiration-use efficiency. We find that water requirements of horticultural crops vary widely, depending on crop type, development stage, and agroecological region, but investigations hitherto have primarily been superficial. Expansion of the horticulture sector has depleted and polluted water resources via overextraction and agrochemical contamination, but the extent and significance of such issues are not well quantified. We contend that innovative management practices and irrigation technologies can improve tactical water management and mitigate environmental impacts. Nature-based solutions in horticulture—mulching, organic amendments, hydrogels, and the like—alleviate irrigation needs, but information relating to their effectiveness across production systems and agroecological regions is limited. Novel and recycled water sources (e.g., treated wastewater, desalination) would seem promising avenues for reducing dependence on natural water resources, but such sources have detrimental environmental and human health trade-offs if not well managed. Irrigation practices including partial root-zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation evoke remarkable improvements in water use efficiency, but require significant experience for efficient implementation. More advanced applications, including IoT and AI (e.g., sensors, big data, data analytics, digital twins), have demonstrable potential in supporting smart irrigation (focused on scheduling) and precision irrigation (improving spatial distribution). While adoption of technologies and practices that improve sustainability is increasing, their application within the horticultural industry as a whole remains in its infancy. Further research, development, and extension is called for to enable successful adaptation to climate change, sustainably intensify food security, and align with other Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/urbansci8030089;The practice of stormwater management has evolved from a singular focus on drainage to a multifaceted approach to support the integrated urban development of healthy, livable, ecological, and water sensitive cities from neighborhood to metropolitan scales. A review of the knowledge base and practice by the professional stormwater management community shows attributes that favor an integrative approach to achieve co-benefits across sectors. Research into stormwater management addresses its functional areas of drainage, flood control, flood plain management, water quality control, urban ecology, recreation, and city beautification. Legacy path dependance affects the potential to reform land use practices, while stormwater management practice is affected by climate change, sea level rise, urbanization, inequality, and poor governance. This review shows a status where technical methods are well advanced but integrative frameworks to address social, ecological and infrastructure needs are more challenging. The sensitivity of ecological issues is most evident in cities in coastal zones. Organizational initiatives are needed to counter the neglect of essential maintenance and sustain flood risk reduction in cities. Stormwater management is related to other integrative tools, including IWRM, One Water, One Health, and Integrated Flood Management, as well as the broader concept of urban planning. This research review demonstrates the opportunities and needs for the advancement of an integrated approach to stormwater management to support urban development. Stormwater capture and rainfall harvesting offer major opportunities to augment scarce water supplies. Nature-based solutions like low-impact development and the sponge city concept show promise to transform cities. Major cities face challenges to sustain conveyance corridors for major flows and to store and treat combined sewer runoff. The neighborhood focus of stormwater management elevates the importance of participation and inclusion to advance environmental justice and strengthen social capital. Integrating organizational initiatives from local to city scales and funding improvements to stormwater systems are major challenges that require leadership from higher governance levels, although governments face resistance to change toward integration, especially in countries with poor land use and public works management systems. Finding solutions to neighborhood issues and the connectivity of water systems at larger scales requires complex approaches to urban planning and represent an important agenda for urban and water governance going forward. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s42532-024-00193-x;The imperative to foster environmental stewardship amidst escalating challenges has driven the adoption of nature-based solutions (NBS) for landscape restoration. This paper explores the implementation and impacts of ecohydrological NBS interventions within the context of sustainable development, focusing on restoring locally valued ecosystem services and catalyzing environmental stewardship to drive environmental, economic, and social sustainability. It posits that if development interventions effectively deliver ecosystem services valuable to stakeholders, impacted communities are likely to support local environmental protection. Ethiopia’s Protecting Lake Hawassa Partnership (PLHP) employed a participatory approach guided by the Natural Resources Risk and Action Framework (NRAF) to engage a diverse network of local stakeholders in restoring and protecting the watershed. Implemented ecohydrological NBS enhanced ecosystem functionality in targeted hillslopes, gullies, and degraded farmlands. Multiple ecosystem services addressing soil erosion, water scarcity, and agricultural productivity were delivered, including productivity enhancement, flood regulation, land preservation, co-benefits from plantation, and moisture conservation. Landscape Functionality Analysis (LFA) revealed significant improvements in ecosystem stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling. Qualitative assessments of the communities’ perception of ecosystem services emphasized the importance of aligning development project outcomes with local needs. Results underscored the robust nexus between NBS, ecosystem services, and environmental stewardship, highlighting the role of perceived benefits in fostering community engagement. The study advocates that environmental management practices, including NBS, which tangibly improve ecosystem services prioritized by local communities, drive stewardship and, therefore, the long-term sustainability of improved environmental protection. Further research is warranted to explore the scalability and cost-effectiveness of NBS interventions in diverse socioeconomic contexts, and to enhance understanding of trade-offs and synergies between economic development, ecological conservation, and social equity in development projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.112374;Children's unequal exposure to nature is associated with the uneven distribution of green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in cities, which often disproportionately affects children living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. School environments are increasingly recognised, both by scientists and policymakers, as priority areas to increase children's exposure to GBI. However, studies analysing the spatial and temporal patterns of GBI in school environments are still scarce, especially those considering a cross-city and equity perspective. To contribute to the expanding field of urban environmental justice in the context of children's geographies, our research aims to assess the (un)equal spatial patterns of school-related GBI across four large European cities (Brussels, Barcelona, Rotterdam, and Paris) and over time (between 2006 and 2018). For this purpose, we used EU-comparable green and blue land cover and tree canopy cover data, together with schools’ socio-economic characteristics (median income and educational attainment) based on local neighbourhood-level data. Through geospatial and statistical analyses on 1259 primary schools, our study reveals significant positive correlations between school-related GBI indicators and socio-economic variables in Brussels and Rotterdam. In contrast, negative correlations were found in Barcelona and Paris. Overall, the four cities show very distinct patterns of school-related socio-environmental inequities and no substantial GBI gains during the period analysed, suggesting that greening initiatives in and around school environments are still to be upscaled at the city level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.forpol.2024.103263;Across the Pacific, deforestation and forest degradation are driving the loss of ecosystem services. Increasing recognition of the need for mechanisms that can bridge economic development and environmental sustainability has led to the emergence of the broad concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), including Payments for Environmental Services (PES) such as ‘reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation’ (REDD+) of forested areas. REDD+ projects are being piloted in the region, but the scale of adoption remains limited raising doubts about whether the concept has much appeal beyond small-scale government-supported initiatives. Although a relatively simple concept, it is proving difficult to translate into an appealing practice that is widely understood and adopted by rural land managers. We conducted a review of the achievements and challenges of REDD+ projects in Melanesia while drawing on global and regional lessons. Most projects are reaping the benefits of enhanced community development, employment, capacity building, and stronger governance. Perverse incentives, lack of systematic assessments of carbon offsets, poor stakeholder engagement, insufficient feedback mechanisms, marginalisation of women, and the lack of prosperous and sustainable alternative livelihoods remain key challenges. This suggests the need for developing policy mixes, understanding the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, addressing equity concerns, strengthening tenure security, removing perverse incentives, and ensuring financially competitive conservation incentives for enhancing the appeal of REDD+ to rural communities, policymakers, and the private sector, so its reach across the Pacific can be extended. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1088/2752-664X/ad5db3;Urban flooding is a major climate change risk that can be mitigated with green infrastructure such as tree plantings and restored naturalised buffers along watercourses. The creation and maintenance of green infrastructure projects for climate change adaptation provides opportunities for community partnerships and programming with co-benefits for human well-being and biodiversity. Here we present findings of action research on flood mitigation and education that was implemented on an urban higher education institution’s campus in partnerships within the university and with local Indigenous peoples, the regional conservation authority, the municipal government, and the public library. Through participatory workshops, we applied bioengineering and mixed planting methods to restore a creek bank. Using a combination of oral storytelling, digital media, and visual art that integrated perspectives across disciplines and knowledge systems, we situated our creek restoration project within a framework of environmental justice, emphasising specific acts of stewardship to improve watershed health and advance reconciliation. We produced digital resources and outreach materials to disseminate lessons from the project into the community and to support similar flood mitigation efforts at local and global scales. Our project demonstrates how incorporating partnerships into the design and implementation of nature-based solutions can build cross-cultural ecological knowledge, forge important on- and off-campus relationships, and create place-based opportunities for students to take direct and measurable action on climate change. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/w16162301;Nature-based solutions (NbS) to water scarcity, environmental degradation, climate change, and biodiversity losses are enjoying increasing implementation throughout the world. This manuscript reviews three case studies from Brazil, Panama, and Portugal that illustrate NbS and searches for commonalities that may assist their usefulness in new sites. The Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro is a remarkable story of centuries of forest management and restoration that initially aimed at providing water security for the capital of the country during the XIX Century while it was still a monarchy. Today, it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Panama Canal Watershed produces water for canal operations, electricity generation, and drinking water for half the country’s population. Traditional water mills and weirs near streams in the Alentejo Region, Portugal, have largely been abandoned due to the damming of the Guadiana River. Yet today, weirs are increasingly recognized for their important contribution to water provisioning in this dry region. All have a primary goal related to water provisioning, yet their ecosystem benefits are multiple. The cases offer important lessons for adaptation to climate change, cultural benefits from traditional human activities, and concerns about social equity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s11252-024-01525-1;Civic transition experiments targeting sustainable food production increasingly engage with edible cities aiming at providing free food on public urban spaces. To deepen the understanding regarding how transition experiments can build urban transformative capacities, this paper presents a transdisciplinary case study on two civic edible city initiatives and their measures to cooperatively initiate, innovate, and accelerate edible cities in Dresden (Germany). We identified the two key action areas “civic participation” and “cooperative area activation” covering ten key transition activities to illustrate the variety and content of a transformation towards an edible city. Based on expert interviews and document analyses, we evaluated their process progression by linking research from urban ecology with transformation science. By visualizing its quantitative results, common and distinct patterns of the edible city initiatives could be made visible. Overall, we found that the level of activity is highest in the key action area of “citizen participation”. In this context, both transition experiments had different but specific foci in terms of their key transition activities (i.e. education, activation of stakeholders), whereby activities related to civic empowerment and social cohesion were lacking in both cases. To re-shape narratives pertaining to land access, food production, and participation under the principles of justice, we suggest that transition experiments related to “civic participation” and “cooperative area activation” must be approached together. Our systematic assessment can then enable civic transition teams to strategically identify common goals that need to be prioritized for initiating, innovating, and accelerating urban edible commons. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1371/journal.pclm.0000328;Nature-based solutions [NbS] can serve as effective strategies to promote the resilience of both people and ecosystems in the face of climate change. However, these solutions can exacerbate existing social inequities if they fail to adequately consider the complex social contexts in which they are implemented. To better understand the equity implications of NbS, and how to design and deliver such strategies more equitably, this study applies a conceptual framework of 4 equity pathways (distributional, procedural, recognitional, and structural equity) to a flood buyout program case study. We utilized document analysis and semi-structured interviews to conduct an equity analysis of a flood buyout program in a rural community in the Catskills region of New York. While many aspects of the flood buyout program aimed to empower local municipalities and landowners, local residents perceived a lack of decision-making power, negative long-term impacts to community well-being, and tension regarding the current and historical power differentials between these rural communities and New York City. Our results indicate individual equity pathways interact with one another in complex ways. They highlight the importance of comprehensive planning and evaluation of community impacts to better address the systems-level relationships that shape the equity implications of buyout programs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2024.103765;Urban green spaces – including parks, trees, and other vegetated areas – are inequitably distributed in cities worldwide, as underserved groups, such as low-income and people of color, have significantly lower provisions of such resources. Motivated by the health benefits of green spaces, advocates and policymakers in several countries have sought to ameliorate these systemic inequities by implementing green space equity initiatives. Many such initiatives are individual projects (e.g., a new park in an underserved neighborhood), but new policies have also been implemented to advance green space equity. To date, limited research has examined which policies have been implemented, what it takes to adopt and implement them, and whether they have effectively advanced green space equity. Based on a scoping literature review and a workshop with an interdisciplinary group of researchers, we developed a research agenda on green space equity policy. Our research agenda includes research questions grouped into four interrelated themes: policy impact and evaluation, power building and policy change, green gentrification, and health equity and climate change. The contributions of this paper are twofold: We synthesize current knowledge on green space equity policy and present a research agenda whose findings can inform policy work on green space equity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105054;Nature-based solutions (NbS) offer pathways towards climate resilient development. For cities, these pathways translate to a host of benefits to address the climate crisis, including climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity protection and enhancement, and human well-being. In urban spaces, NbS are also about the design and re-design of the urban built and natural environment. This presents a need to create the institutions and governance mechanisms that allow for the co-production and co-design of NbS alongside local communities in ways that serve to address justice and legacies of inequality. In this perspective, I examine three areas of focus to deliver just nature-based solutions: problem, process, and progress. Problem focuses on the types of relationships nature-based solutions seek to transform—the race and class-based inequalities embedded in urban form. Process addresses how nature-based solutions can deliver justice through design and co-production. Finally, progress is about developing indicators and measuring progress towards achieving just nature-based solutions and how they reflect diverse and pluralistic value systems. Collectively these should move just NbS towards the repair of social and ecological exploitation in and beyond the city. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-58144-1_13;"This chapter deals with solutions, affordability and the power of civil society to keep climate change within tolerable limits. Due to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the consequences of a global warming of +1.5 °C have been and are mainly explained and communicated. However, we are heading for +3 °C by the end of the century. Due to the non-linear progression of the consequences of increasing global warming, this leads to a world that becomes a threat to all of humanity and to all societies. The overwhelming majority of the world's population is unaware of this. In order to prevent such a devastating three-degree scenario, democracies need three prerequisites: Information campaigns by politicians make the population aware of the consequences of +3 °C global warming and assure that no further financial burdens will fall on the majority of the population (climate justice). In addition, the Paris climate treaty must be supplemented: Nature-based solutions must immediately become part of climate protection policy; they can be implemented promptly, at relatively low cost and, above all, in a socially acceptable manner. The political will to invest at least about two trillion US$ annually (2% of the world social product) in climate protection policy by the year 2050 must be organized. Two types of tax, the inheritance tax and the financial transaction tax, are the focus for raising the financial resources for this investment requirement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100131;Statement of problem: Green gentrification is an emerging issue, where Urban green space (UGS) upgrades lead to higher living costs, displacing lower-income residents, raising concerns about accessibility, sustainability, and equity. This phenomena challenges the inclusive and equitable development of urban environments. Purpose: Through an integrative analysis of existing literature, this study aims to address a significant gap in current research by exploring how Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) can more effectively counteract the adverse effects of UGS gentrification. Method: Utilizing a scoping literature review, the research analyzes articles from 2015 to 2024 to synthesize insights for a more equitable urban development. Results: Findings reveal diverse lessons learned and strategies for countering green gentrification across different urban settings worldwide. However, a significant number of studies predominantly focus on the Global North, primarily in Europe and North America, which may lead to a regional bias. Practical implications: The results provide insights for policymakers, urban planners, and communities, guiding the creation of more inclusive and sustainable urban green spaces. Future directions: Further research should focus on developing quantitative metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of NbS in mitigating urban gentrification and expanding the geographic focus to include more underrepresented regions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2023.100106;A closer look at the built environment shows that opportunities lie in transforming buildings with nature-based solutions for fostering climate resilience. To understand the potential of buildings in contributing to transforming cities, we conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize the evidence of the provided benefits of nature-based solutions implemented on their roofs and facades. Our goal is to highlight findings about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions on buildings in real-life case studies. After systematic screening and selection, the 222 reviewed research papers support that there is confidence in the climate resilience performance and benefits green walls, green roofs, and living walls provide, contributing to heat resilience and indirectly to social-ecological justice, especially when they are installed in old buildings. Our findings show that other recorded benefits include the provision of vegetation, habitat and biodiversity enhancement, and strong evidence of water retention and purification. We also report on design characteristics of nature-based solutions which are recommended when they are implemented on buildings. Green roofs were especially well-documented and it underlines the need of more studies about diverse NBS. From the synthesis of the state of the art, we propose that further research about the design of nature-based solutions on buildings is required to extend their co-benefits to noise reduction, air pollution entrapment and filtering, and carbon sequestration. In our paper, we found that the most important knowledge gap for future research is holistic perspectives on designing NBS on buildings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2024.128358;This study contributes to empirical evidence about how design and maintenance of vacant lot greening in the form of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) may benefit vulnerable populations - specifically people living with depressive symptoms or who experience household flooding. Legacy cities like Detroit, Michigan, have high rates of property vacancy with associated community concerns about personal safety and vacant lot maintenance. Past studies have linked both neighborhood vacant land and flooding experience with negative mental health effects. In contrast, greenspace experiences have been linked with mental health benefits. Greenspaces include microscale landscape elements that can operate as cues to care (CTC) or cues to safety (CTS). We examined whether self-reported experiences of depressive symptoms and household flooding would affect perceptions of vacant lot greening characterized by varied CTC and CTS. Using in-home structured interviews, we surveyed 316 Detroit households to measure residents’ perceptions of care and safety of GSI design treatments. Participants viewed 28 × 43 cm colored prints representing 14 alternative treatments on two replicate sites and a control vacant lot. Those reporting depressive symptoms perceived significantly less care and safety across all treatments than others. Those reporting flooding experience did not have significantly different perceptions than others. Further, a model testing a three-way interaction between flooding experience, depressive symptoms, and CTC showed no significant association with perceived care and safety. Most importantly, our findings suggest that people experiencing depressive symptoms do not perceive greenspace experiences in the same way as others. Future research should examine how different microscale landscape elements of greenspace might benefit people with specific mental health conditions differently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1088/2752-664X/ad53cf;Nature-based solutions have gained popularity as an approach to reduce the impacts of climate and environmental change, providing multi-fold and multi-sectoral benefits especially in cities. Yet there has been growing concern about their utility for cities of the Global South, a concern fuelled by the paucity of studies, including scientific peer reviewed and gray literature. In this paper, we contribute to this knowledge gap, based on an analysis of 120 case studies of NBS in Global South cities, documented in two databases (Urban Natural Atlas and Oppla). These cases fall largely under categories of blue and green infrastructure, with a few cases also focusing on grey infrastructure (in buildings or campuses). While most cases are in Asia, several have also been documented in Africa and Central/South America. Two-third of documented NBS cases are aligned towards either national, or lower-level (regional and local) policies indicating the importance of policy mechanisms for driving their implementation. Institutional arrangements are usually non-government, government or collaborative arrangements, with the goal of climate resilience, biodiversity support and ecosystem restoration—along with social goals of creating public spaces. However, when private players take on the mandate for NBS, they focus primarily on grey infrastructure (in buildings and campuses), primarily meant for private or employee benefits, and not for the public. In cases where public engagement is a stated priority, we find tokenistic approaches deployed, primarily seeking engagement through information dissemination and consultation predominate. Despite the stated importance for participation and engagement, only a few cases focused on empowerment and co-creation of NBS with local communities. We suggest that there is a greater need for documentation regarding the modes of participation especially on roles and levels of actors involved, to enrich our understanding of the impact of NBS on values of justice and equity in the cities of the global South. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cub.2024.02.031;The global community has outlined ambitious ecosystem restoration targets. Yet implementation is slow, and a lack of funding is a key barrier to upscaling restoration activities. Most restoration projects are funded by public institutions and recent high-level initiatives have emphasised the need to scale private finance in restoration. Private finance can be channelled into restoration through various financial mechanisms but is held back by a lack of return-making investment opportunities. Various institutions have now been created to commodify previously non-market ecosystem services and make them investable, most prominently voluntary carbon markets and biodiversity compliance market-like mechanisms, such as biodiversity-offsetting systems targeting the achievement of ‘no net loss’ of biodiversity for a given regulated sector. However, attracting private finance into restoration comes with risks, as private finance objectives in restoration often are misaligned with wider social and ecological objectives. Private finance mechanisms to date have tended to underinvest in monitoring and impact evaluation mechanisms and to favour investments in cost-effective nature-based solutions such as plantation monocultures over naturally regenerated ecosystems. Many technological and institutional solutions have been proposed, but these cannot mitigate all risks. Therefore, scaling of ecosystem restoration through market-like mechanisms requires substantial fundamental investments in governance and civil society oversight to ensure that ecological integrity and social equity is safeguarded. Here, we outline the high-level policy landscape driving restoration finance and explore the roles and potential of both public and private investment in restoration. We explain how some common mechanisms for drawing private investment into restoration work in practice. Then, we discuss some of the shortcomings of past private finance initiatives for ecosystem restoration and highlight essential lessons for how to safeguard the ecological and social outcomes of private investments in ecosystem restoration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2024.105022;Dryland agroforestry is often hailed as a nature-based solution for rural people's water- and climate-related struggles, yet appraisals of traditional agroforestry practices and interventions in Maghreb countries are scant. In this study, we appraise whether and how agroforestry delivers as a solution to Moroccan farmers’ plight with drought. Through an analysis of landscape observations, 75 qualitative interviews, and six group discussions, we show that the region's mountain residents risk losing their livelihoods due to intersecting impacts of failed water governance, maladaptation, and drought. Water scarcity has hampered farmers’ production landscapes in recent years, but neither traditional agroforestry practices nor newly planted tree stands provide communities with secure income in times of little rainfall. A key agricultural sector policy – the Green Morocco Plan – incentivized water-intensive tree plantations, which added pressure on groundwater resources as more-affluent farmers built wells. However, it has done little to support most mountain residents in coping with water scarcity or adapting to evolving climate-related risks. Farmers’ aspirations and knowledge could offer policy-relevant insights on how to co-create viable livelihoods and plan for sustainable landscape change in the region's tree-crop landscapes. Identified entry points include governance interventions for greater water justice and public spending to tap the sustainable potential of local catchments and establish drought-tolerant crops. Our results underscore the urgent need for regional planning and landscape design in support of North Africa's drought-stricken farming communities. However, without due attention to people's everyday vulnerabilities and resulting water-justice implications, adaptation-oriented tree-planting schemes are misplaced and may well set people off on maladaptive routes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1371/journal.pclm.0000206;"Land degradation and climate change are intertwined global challenges, their implications on human health are driven by the unsustainable use of natural resources, resulting in the loss of vital ecosystem services that support human health. There are equity implications in that landscape degradation disproportionately affects vulnerable populations that live in the most fragile ecosystems. Solutions to reverse degradation are increasingly considered attractive because of their ability to meet multiple societal objectives, however, their implementation has outpaced research on impact; the research and evidence gaps are particularly acute in relation to quantifying the health and well-being impacts of nature-based solutions. This study documents the experiences of rural communities implementing Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) in Central Tanzanian drylands, which integrates trees in agricultural landscapes. FMNR technique has been hailed as the largest positive environmental transformation in African drylands due to its effectiveness in restoring landscapes at very low costs. Despite its success, the impact on human well-being is largely unquantified. We used in-depth group discussions across four villages to document how respondents perceive the health and well-being impacts of natural regeneration. We thereafter adapted the ecosystem services cascade model to conceptualise the pathways between natural regeneration and impact on health and well-being. Respondents across all study sites unanimously reported how FMNR implementation has reversed decades of land degradation, resulting in physical and mental health benefits that can be linked to food and nutritional security, improved air and water quality, income diversification, heat adaptation and gender equality. We demonstrate how the application of the cascade model can generate causal pathways that 1) map how changes in ecosystem structure, functions and services can result in measurable health outcomes, and, 2) support empirical investigation by defining concrete metrics for monitoring and evaluation of interventions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad33d2;"Heat stress adversely impacts a growing proportion of individuals in India. The heat-related lived experiences of Indians in smaller towns and villages are largely unknown. We conducted seven structured focus group discussions in the town of Dalkhola, West Bengal, India; with 5-10 participants in each group. All conversations were digitally audio recorded, transcribed into Bengali, and then translated to English. Two researchers separately performed a thematic analysis of the transcripts to identify common themes pertaining to the ‘effects of heat’ and ‘coping strategies’ used by participants. A total of 56 (mean age 48.9 ± 17.6; female 61%; Scheduled Tribe 9%) individuals participated. There was wide variation in individual experiences of heat, with some people preferring to work in the winter while others preferred the summer. Housing characteristics, nature of work, gender and access to water and green spaces heavily influenced an individual’s vulnerability to heat stress. Trees were seen as the primary coping strategy for heat stress (regardless of vulnerability), though many participants noted a loss of tree cover in their vicinity. Cool drinking water from public taps and electric fans (particularly table fans) were other preferred coping mechanisms. Many participants did not have adequate access to cool drinking water or electric fans, leading to increased adverse experiences from heat. Based on participant input, several action items were identified for municipal and state/central governments, schools, and private organizations. Individuals affected by heat have a clear preference for nature-based solutions. This is in contrast with the current design of most heat action plans in India, which put more emphasis on infrastructure, information dissemination and behavioral solutions. Various agencies (governments, schools, private organizations) seeking to adapt to increasing heat stress need to better integrate citizen perspectives into their heat action plans. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.cities.2024.104799;Nature-based solutions (NBS) are championed for providing co-benefits to cities and residents, yet their environmental justice impacts are increasingly debated. In this paper, we explore whether and how hybrid governance approaches, such as Mosaic Governance, may contribute to just transformations and sustainable cities through fostering long-term collaborations between local governments, local communities, and grassroots initiatives. Based on case studies in three major European cities, we propose and then exemplify six possible pathways to increase environmental justice: greening the neighborhood, diversifying values and practices, empowering people, bridging across communities, linking to institutions, and scaling of inclusive discourses and practices. Despite the diversity of environmental justice outcomes across cases, our results consistently show that Mosaic Governance particularly contributes to recognition justice through diversifying NBS practices in alignment with community values and aspirations. The results demonstrate the importance of a wider framing of justice in the development of NBS, sensitive to social, cultural, economic and political inequities as well understanding potential pathways to enhance not only environmental justice, but also social justice at large. Especially in marginalised communities, Mosaic Governance holds much potential to advance social justice by enabling empowering, bridging, and linking pathways across diverse communities and NBS practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Yet the transboundary governance dimensions of NbS remain unclear and largely undocumented. In Southeast Asia, NbS have emphasised the conservation and/ or sustainable commodification of carbon sinks found in terrestrial and mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, peatlands and agricultural soils. Mostly project-driven and fixed-term, these “solutions” have often failed to meet their social and ecological objectives. Increasingly, they have added to cross-border problems of: (1) displaced carbon emissions; and (2) economic migration and societal dispossession. This perspective paper delineates a transboundary governance research agenda to mitigate these trade-offs and enhance the co-benefits of NbS in carbon sinks.

10.6093/1970-9870/10210;Climate change is the ultimate threat multiplier, since it worsens most of humanity’s most pressing environmental, societal, and economic challenges. Anyway, growing urbanisation brings both opportunities and challenges related to the ongoing transition process, since cities are at the forefront of changes and challenges. Regeneration of urban areas is a significant priority, which needs to take into account environmental quality, social justice and sustainable development. Transforming cities and regions into vibrant, sustainable, and resilient living places has become a key global priority. In the light of the above, the article – in the context of ongoing research activities – focuses on the ecological transition in the EU panorama, highlighting the active and decisive role of cities, with reference to some significant case studies in the implementation of Green and Nature-based Solutions (NBS) through an integrated, forward-looking, and broad-based planning approach. It is structured in three main parts. The first part frames the topic in the international scientific context. The second one, in the EU panorama, highlights the fundamental role of NBS with reference to the methodological approach, and the latest and most innovative ongoing policies, strategies, and practices.

This chapter introduces a role-playing method that was applied in a real-world urban development case within an interdisciplinary master’s course focusing on nature-based solutions. The aim of the activity was to illustrate the complexity of participatory and co-creation processes in urban planning and to enhance students’ empathy and understanding of relevant diverse perspectives, values, and knowledge. This chapter presents a model for the role-playing method that can be adapted to various teaching contexts and implemented within a relatively short timeframe. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3167/ares.2024.150101;Ecological restoration practices and technologies are emerging as a dominant tool for addressing global environmental crises. This shift in conservation from a protectionist paradigm to a more hands-on approach signifies a new era of active intervention to the repair of ecosystems. Such approaches demand novel forms of human participation, fostering new kinds of relations, practices, values, and assumptions of what is “natural.” This special issue brings together reviews reflecting the diversity of perspectives and questions raised by social scientists on the practice of ecological restoration, restoration technologies, and restoration logics. Together they reveal three interconnected themes: (1) Politics are inherent to restoration practices of care and repair, raising questions about the logics and values that drive restoration, and the kinds of natures these generate. (2) Restoration is embedded in historical and social-political contexts, reflecting ongoing discussions on the implications of restoration in terms of environmental justice and equity. (3) Restoration is a relational practice that engages human–ecological entanglement and responsibility as central for the repair of social ecologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/B978-0-443-29240-8.00020-1;Manmade technology plays an important role in responding to the climate crisis. But nature-based solutions are also critical components of climate mitigation and adaptation. The integrity of the Earth’s natural environment is intrinsically linked to the health and wellbeing of humanity. Improving the conditions of local and global ecosystems aids in mitigation and adaptation activities such as carbon sequestration and storm surge prevention while also providing a myriad of public health cobenefits. For example, while increasing green spaces and tree cover in urban environments cools the surrounding air temperature to mitigate extreme heat, it simultaneously improves mental health outcomes. Nature-based solutions cannot solve the entirety of the climate crisis but they can and should be incorporated into climate and health policies in tandem with engineered solutions to provide a systemic approach to adaptation and mitigation strategies. Additionally, climate justice should be at the core of any nature-based solution implementation plan and should provide these solutions to communities that are often left behind while experiencing the worst health effects of climate change. This chapter seeks to explore vetted nature-based solutions in different contexts while illustrating their public health cosbenefits. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/26395916.2024.2430591;Increasing attention to the concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) requests a reflection on the role of young people for just urban development. This study explores how upper secondary school students (age from 16 to 19) relationally learn about environmental justice issues through role-play. Ten workshops were conducted in May 2022, involving 197 students from two upper secondary schools in Helsinki, Finland. We used role-play as a learning activity to actively involve students in working with justice perceptions which emerged from discussions about the implementation of NBS in their school district. The findings are based on both participant observation and two surveys conducted before and after the activity. The study shows how the role-play positively impacted the students’ understanding of environmental justice issues related to NBS, complementing it with a higher recognition of different values for green spaces and trade-offs concerning their management. Finally, the role-play enabled students to explore new perceptions of recognition justice, expanding their sense of community to new cultures and non-human entities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fpubh.2024.1462561;Background: Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are vital for addressing climate change and biodiversity loss, yet their benefits are often unequally distributed. This study introduces the Environmental Health Citizen Interview Tool, aiming to inclusively capture diverse perspectives on environmental wellbeing using qualitative research methods. The principles of epistemic justice and planetary health are central to its development. Methods: The Environmental Health Citizen Interview Tool was developed as a qualitative tool, incorporating a simple visualization scoring system for responses. Six environmental health determinants were selected, with in-depth open-ended follow-up questions. Content validation involved transdisciplinary expert consultation. A guidebook for using the tool was also developed. Findings: The tool offers a comprehensive approach to inquire environmental wellbeing, accommodating diverse perspectives through in-depth inquiries. Limitations include the need for further validation and testing. Interpretation: The Environmental Health Citizen Interview Tool provides a practical framework for inclusive assessment of environmental wellbeing, aligned with planetary health and epistemic justice principles. Its application should be complemented by quantitative environmental monitoring such as air quality and be contextualized by local researchers for reliability and relevance. Future research should focus on refining the tool and exploring its utility in diverse settings to inform equitable local policy interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/26395916.2024.2409165;In the face of systematic expropriation, massive biodiversity loss, and the ongoing climate crisis, Indigenous peoples, knowledge, and labor have protected over 80% of the global biodiversity. This is remarkable given that Indigenous management or tenure remains over 20–25% of the planet’s terrestrial surface. Indigenous people’s capacity to protect biodiversity within their territories cannot be separated from the ethical frameworks that shape their relationships with land. These frameworks have been articulated by a diverse array of Indigenous scholars across the globe, and while they cannot be generalized, many share principles that go beyond dominant Western Scientific approaches that normalize utilitarian or idealized (e.g. ideals of wilderness) ethical systems. We argue that dominant policy and research discourses around land-based practices such as nature-based solutions and green infrastructure, will not be effective ‘solutions’ to ongoing crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Instead, we must go beyond paradigms of improvement and anthropocentric utility and ground land-based practices in the paradigm of relational ethics. Through this perspective paper, we argue that rather than seeking solutions through redesigning ecosystems for utilitarian reasons, all interventions on Indigenous ancestral lands (recognized by settler states or not) should first center relational ethical approaches for land-based design practices and ground efforts in Indigenous justice. Our proposed ‘Indigenous Justice Frameworks for Relational Ethics in Land-based Design’ is based on the inseparability of bodies, lands, and knowledges, and is guided by the following elements: (1) generative refusal, (2) centering healing, reparation, and right relations, and (3) restoring and evolving Indigenous governance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/14733285.2024.2418644;Green spaces provide multiple benefits to physical and mental health, especially for children. Meanwhile, children are not typically included in most participatory processes regarding green spaces and their needs, if at all, tend to be represented by adults. This study attempts to answer the following research questions: (1) Does the degree of children’s participation differ depending on the spatial scale of green space planning processes? (2) How can children’s participation be interpreted in the context of environmental justice? We used mixed methods to assess the legal condition, process flow and products of three participatory processes regarding green space planning in Lodz (Poland). Our findings demonstrate that even the seemingly well-intentioned processes may fail to adequately incorporate children because of procedural inconsistencies and other deficiencies. Even if a process allows children to express their opinions, it fails to translate these voices into reality. We highlight the need to increase awareness of the importance of children’s inclusion in participatory processes to guarantee that their needs are considered, endow children with pro-environmental behaviours, and promote the idea of civil society. We contribute to the environmental justice debate by demonstrating the necessity of differentiating between procedural and participatory environmental justice dimensions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.11159/icceia24.170;In the face of accelerating climate change, sea level rise stands as one of the most pressing challenges confronting coastal communities worldwide. This abstract delves into the imperative of integrating sea level considerations into civil engineering practice to foster resilient and sustainable coastal development. With sea levels projected to rise by significant margins in the coming decades due to melting polar ice caps and thermal expansion, coastal infrastructure faces unprecedented threats, including inundation, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Civil engineers play a pivotal role in confronting these challenges by adopting proactive strategies that harmonize traditional engineering practices with evolving climate realities. Embracing a multidisciplinary approach, this integration involves the synthesis of cutting-edge scientific research, innovative engineering methodologies, and adaptive governance frameworks [1]. At the core of integrating sea level considerations lies a paradigm shift from conventional design approaches to proactive adaptation strategies that account for long-term environmental dynamics. Civil engineering practices traditionally rely on historical data and static design criteria, often overlooking the dynamic nature of coastal ecosystems and the inherent uncertainties associated with climate change. In contrast, integrating sea level considerations necessitates a forward-looking approach that incorporates future sea level projections, extreme weather events, and ecosystem dynamics into infrastructure planning and design processes. This entails employing advanced modeling techniques, such as hydrodynamic simulations, coupled with probabilistic risk assessments to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise on coastal infrastructure [2], [3]. Moreover, the integration of sea level considerations underscores the importance of adopting nature-based solutions and sustainable engineering practices to enhance coastal resilience. Traditional hard infrastructure, such as seawalls and revetments, while effective in the short term, can exacerbate coastal erosion and disrupt natural sediment transport processes, leading to unintended consequences. In contrast, nature-based solutions, such as living shorelines, wetlands restoration, and beach nourishment, offer multifaceted benefits, including shoreline stabilization, habitat enhancement, and carbon sequestration. By incorporating these nature-based approaches into civil engineering projects, practitioners can create more resilient coastal landscapes that adapt and evolve in response to changing sea levels while preserving ecosystem services and biodiversity [4]. Furthermore, integrating sea level considerations necessitates a paradigm shift in risk management frameworks to account for uncertainty and complexity. Traditional risk assessment methodologies often rely on deterministic approaches that underestimate the inherent uncertainties associated with climate change and fail to capture the interconnectedness of socio-ecological systems. In contrast, a holistic risk management approach emphasizes adaptive planning, community engagement, and participatory decision-making processes to build consensus, foster social equity, and enhance resilience. By embracing a diversity of perspectives and integrating local knowledge systems, civil engineers can develop contextspecific solutions that address the unique challenges and opportunities posed by sea level rise [5], [6]. In conclusion, integrating sea level considerations into civil engineering practice represents a transformative opportunity to foster resilient and sustainable coastal development in the face of climate change. By adopting proactive adaptation strategies, embracing nature-based solutions, and reimagining risk management frameworks, civil engineers can play a central role in shaping a more resilient future for coastal communities worldwide. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to sustainability, the integration of sea level considerations holds the promise of creating coastal landscapes that are not only resilient to sea level rise but also vibrant, equitable, and thriving ecosystems for generations to come [7]. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/B978-0-443-32824-4.00004-3;The Andean mountain range is home to many urban dwellers who depend on services and infrastructure that are at risk from natural hazards and climate change impacts. Over the past decades, promising future-oriented urban development strategies have been developed and implemented, linking infrastructure development to environmental protection and social justice. Based on two case studies of water and transport infrastructures in Quito and Bogotá, the potential of mountain cities to inspire global agendas and strategies toward a sustainable urban future in the face of global change is described. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fpos.2024.1362526;The rise in global sea levels poses a substantial, sometimes existential threat to coastal cities around the world, such as Bangkok, Lagos, or Jakarta. Adaptation projects range from hard infrastructure to nature-based solutions or ‘planned retreat’, often having severe implications in terms of equity and equality. Given the threat of urban flooding and submergence, this paper asks how ‘the future’ for these cities is imagined, and how sociotechnical imaginaries of climate futures inform policymaking. Using insights from poststructuralism and Science and Technology Studies (STS), I argue that the way of ‘seeing’ and ‘knowing’ sea level rise is constitutive of the rationalities that undergird the governing of rising water around the world. I trace the discrete operations of the discursive formations and imaginaries that have evolved globally around the issue of sea level rise, with their own distinctive logics. Analyzing a variety of globally circulating policy documents and local adaptation projects, I show how the governance of sea level rise is based on a very specific ‘expert’ knowledge that allows re-designing sinking cities ‘from above’. This kind of knowledge, provided by a depoliticizing global network of consultants, designers, and development banks, privileges imaginaries of modernity and control using technology and engineering, as well as ideas on how populations in flood-prone areas are expected to govern themselves in the advent of rising sea levels. These imaginaries tend to marginalize alternative local adaptation practices, lead to unintended outcomes, and often discriminate against those who are already vulnerable to climate change impacts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fepid.2024.1212114;Introduction: There is growing interest in creating public green spaces to promote health. Yet, discussions about these efforts often overlook how experiences of chronic discrimination—which may manifest as racism, sexism, or homophobia, and more—could undermine satisfaction with nature experiences. Methods: Using data from the 2018 wave of the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey (GSS), we quantified associations of frequency of everyday discrimination, operationalized using the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS, the primary independent variable), with respondents' perceptions of nature experiences and with their reported time spent in nature. Specifically, we quantified associations with the following three variables: (1) dissatisfaction with day-to-day experiences of nature, (2) not spending as much time as they would like in natural environments, and (3) usually spending at least one day per week in nature. We used survey-weighted robust Poisson models to estimate overall associations, and also stratified analyses by racial/ethnic and gender identity categories. Results: Of 768 GSS respondents, 14% reported dissatisfaction with nature experiences, 36% reported not spending as much time as they would like in nature, and 33% reported that they did not spend at least one day per week in nature. The median non-standardized EDS, coded such that a higher value indicates greater frequency of discrimination, was 11 (interquartile range: 8, 15). Prevalence of reporting dissatisfaction with day-to-day experiences in nature was 7% higher in association with every one unit increase in EDS score above the median (PR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.11). The prevalence of reporting not spending as much time as one would like in nature was 2% higher for every unit increase in higher than median everyday discrimination frequency (PR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.05). Higher than median frequency in everyday discrimination was not associated with spending less than one day per week in nature. Race/ethnicity and gender identity did not modify associations. Conclusion: Greater frequency of everyday discrimination is associated with less satisfaction with experiences in nature. This relationship could undermine efforts to promote health equity through green interventions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/25741292.2024.2368919;Humanity faces a rising number of challenging disasters due to their increasing unpredictability and scale. While large-scale engineering solutions have been the mainstream approach, there is a growing acknowledgment that ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) is a suitable approach in the long term due to its cost-effectiveness, social equity, and environmental sustainability. Governments worldwide are integrating Eco-DRR into policies and legislation. Here, we review the extent of integration of Eco-DRR into DRR policies and legislation in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh using content analysis based on five criteria: acknowledgment, inclusion, weighting, resources, and reflexivity. While Eco-DRR principles are acknowledged and included in the national policies of these three countries, they are not prioritized as compared to competing alternatives due to limited integration tools. Resource allocation is directed towards prevention and relief mitigation, with limited emphasis on research and capacity building, which are crucial for strengthening Eco-DRR. Notably, policy aspirations still need to be realized in legislative action. Strengthening Eco-DRR requires enhanced integration, capacity-building, and robust institutions to boost resilience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fevo.2024.1271182;There is consensus within psychological, physiological, medical, and social science disciplines that active and passive exposure to nature enhances human well-being. Natural infrastructure (NI) includes elements of nature that can deliver these ancillary well-being benefits while serving their infrastructure-related purposes and, as such, offer great promise for agencies including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a means of enhancing economic, environmental, and societal benefits in civil works projects. Yet, to date, NI are typically framed as alternatives to conventional infrastructure but are rarely competitive for project selection because there is no standardized approach to demonstrate their value or justify their cost. The infrastructure projects subsequently selected may not maximize societal well-being or distribute benefits equitably. A framework is needed to capture diverse and holistic benefits of NI. As part of ongoing research, this paper describes the components necessary to construct a framework for well-being benefits accounting and equitable distribution of NI projects and explores how they might be applied within a framework. We conclude with methodological examples of well-being accounting tools for NI that are based on ongoing research and development associated with this project. The findings provide insights and support for both the Engineering with Nature community and the community of NI practitioners at large. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.4324/9781003436652;This book addresses the major policy, economic and financial issues encountered in global forest carbon. The global forest sector is expected to play a major role in achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature targets. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore practical and promising solutions to the challenges facing carbon accounting and policy assessment as the global community undertakes forest sector actions-including the widely known REDD+ initiative. This book demonstrates how vital it is that we identify appropriate perspectives and formulate approaches to address these challenges in an integrated and effective manner. In doing so, it addresses many of the major issues, including the differential potentials for carbon sequestration within various forest ecosystems as well as for storage within a variety of harvested wood products, the joint production of timber and carbon, and the measurement and impact of forest carbon offsets and credits, results-based payments, and other nationally determined contributions centered differences as well. The book examines regional and country-level case studies from across the world and draws on the author’s decades of experience working on forest policy and with the forest sector. Overall, this book highlights the technical and policy issues regarding forest sector carbon emission and removal to build useful perspectives, frameworks, and methods for addressing these issues successfully in the future. It advances the knowledge frontiers of global forest carbon policy, economics and finance as well as the ability to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of forest climate solutions. This book is essential reading for professionals and policymakers working at the intersection of forest policy, carbon storage and climate change, as well as students and researchers in the fields of forestry, natural resource management, climate change and nature-based solutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.30564/jees.v6i1.5995;Despite prevailing interests, no rigorous research has been conducted to examine the role of nature in natural-hazard preparedness. This systematic review aimed to describe how nature can reduce the impacts of natural hazards during the preparedness stage. The study focuses on the land, water, and air systems and on three types of stakeholders: international organizations, developed countries, and developing countries. Further, it provides supplementary strategies, such as immediate actions, local engagement, and research and development, that the stakeholders should apply to enhance their nature-based natural-hazard preparedness. We suggest integrating costs and benefits analysis, local culture, societal challenges, and environmental justice into the implementation of nature-based solutions. Finally, this review outlines the framework of nature-based natural-hazard preparedness by discussing the relationship between nature and society. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-54096-7_55;Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly adopted as measures for enabling climate change mitigation and adaptation, for reducing flood risks and for enhancing urban ecosystems. However, several barriers hinder the implementation of NBS in urban areas, in planning activities and strategies. These include the inadequacy of some existing methods based on hard and top-down approaches, the complexity and uncertainty associated with the network of citizens involved and the structuring of the knowledge deriving from that, in urban strategies. References emphasized the need to take citizens and their local knowledge into account when assessing the effectiveness of NBS implementation in planning strategies. Local knowledge could help to understand the success or failure of actions designed only by expert knowledge. Furthermore, shared local knowledge could increases social justice and the consequent livability of urban context. To this aim, this paper proposes a bottom-up methodological approach to assess the effectiveness of NBS implementation in spatial planning strategies, starting from local knowledge. The methodology was applied experimentally by involving high school students in the city of Brindisi (IT). Group Model Building (GMB) aimed at the exchange, generation, acquisition and dissemination of local knowledge of students involved, about NBS implementation in territorial planning strategies. Specifically, the GMB exercise used (i) Fuzzy Cognitive Maps to build a knowledge model of the students involved, (ii) geographic maps to define specific urban areas requiring NBS implementation, (iii) scenario building to define the benefits and possible shortcomings of NBS implementation in the urban context and spatial planning strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.5334/bc.379;Globally, various frames of urban nature circulate, each emphasising particular challenges and natural solutions in the climate context. Yet which actors and dynamics shape their translation to the African context remains unclear. This paper explores the global-to-local translation process of frames through interventions funded by transnational actors, conceptualised as agents of policy transfer. Critical scholarship has observed that urban adaptation and resilience interventions in Africa are often characterised as technocratic and top-down approaches, hence it is vital to understand whether these are replicated through proliferating nature-based solutions (NBSs). The study of a resilience-building intervention in Lilongwe, Malawi, reveals that transnational actors play important roles by deploying frames of urban nature through funding projects. However, rather than involving a top-down imposition of particular solutions, this sets in motion dynamics: in the competition for resources that frames generate, various actor constellations of transnational actors, subnational governments and local NGOs reconfigure or relabel strategies and associated (nature-based) practices to suit global frames and the resources they generate. This shapes who is included or not, and what kinds of NBS are being developed, for and by whom. There is a risk that priorities of communities get lost in translation. POLICY RELEVANCE Frames of urban nature shape global agendas but also matter locally in the design of programmes and projects. This study provides key insights of relevance for policymakers. First, external funding for climate and resilience is unpredictable and insufficient to address manifold urgent local priorities. It is important that actors at all levels strive to align resources to holistic strategies of local governments and do not impose certain visions for urban nature. For this to happen, and second, it is key that local governments and communities are empowered to create forms of nature that are built around diverse forms of local knowledge and expertise, to cater to values and priorities of the communities. Third, proponents of NBSs highlight their potential to address interlinked climate-, biodiversity-and society-related challenges. However, unless funding allocation puts emphasis on the interlinkage of goals, the potential for NBSs to reach multiple goals can get lost. Fourth, there is a need to disrupt the persisting scepticism concerning the feasibility of NBSs in informal settlements and forge collaborations that realise interventions closely linked to the priorities of disadvantaged groups in African cities, to leverage the power of nature for more just societies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/1523908X.2023.2279059;Responsive land-use policy amid climate change in urban settings includes infrastructure transformation and necessitates recognizing community- and individual-level vulnerabilities as well as climate-driven injustices, which are isolated in the existing literature. This paper highlights how climate policies set in the nine cities of Turkey identify vulnerable groups and individuals, and develop land-use policy to address the identified vulnerabilities and climate justice concerns. Employing policy content analysis and expert interviews, we find critical relationships between the identified vulnerable groups, responsive land-use policy, and climate justice. While social-aid municipalism-related vulnerabilities dominate the districts’ climate policies, nature-based solutions (NBS), especially green infrastructure and urban agriculture, emerge as the dominant climate adaptation solutions. The way urban vulnerabilities are prioritized in the climate and sustainability plans put less emphasis on intersectionality and urban infrastructure-related vulnerabilities. With tokenism of justice taking place in policy documents, the plans do not incorporate vulnerable communities in land-use planning. Ultimately, the complexity of responsive land-use policies for cities must cultivate a greater awareness of how to support vulnerable communities practically. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103624;"The need to include pluralistic values of nature in conservation projects, including Nature-based Solutions (NbS), has become evident, and calls for value pluralism have gained traction. However, it is unclear how this can be implemented in practice. We explore how pluralism and related social equity are incorporated by practitioners involved in the governance of NbS, analysing five cases identified as exemplary by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. We develop a conceptual framework of social equity founded on five components: recognition, participation, distribution, rights, and accountability. This framework guides our analysis of primary data from in-depth interviews and secondary data from project reports. We discuss how practitioners assimilate these components in their practices and in the design of governance processes. The results indicate a strong commitment to participation and local communities’ involvement, evidenced by specific practices across the projects, although at times driven by individuals rather than institutionally. Processes were conceived to foster actor participation, including those in vulnerable positions; build local capacity and strengthen ownership. Approaches to local communities’ involvement typically begin by eliciting their views and values to design projects with ecological and social benefits. We discuss good practices, like extensive stakeholder mapping, citizen committees to represent local views, and multi-stakeholder platforms to articulate and communicate people's views and values. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive governance approach following an enhanced concept of pluralism that, beside considering plural values of nature and beyond social equity, includes diverse voices, perspectives and forms of knowledge in conservation governance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/978-3-031-62293-9_5;The central idea for establishing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is achieving well-being for all while protecting the environment and welfare for future generations with 17 interlinked Sustainable development goals (SDGs). These goals are no poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water, life on land, peace, justice, and strong institutions, and partnerships for the goals. To achieve the segoalsblue-green infrastructure (BGI) can play avital role as it promotes sustainable and resource-efficient living. Utilizing urban planning, ecological restoration, and infrastructure to foster a sense of community with the natural world, the BGI network offers the “ingredients” for resolving urban and climatic concerns. Under BGI the water bodies like rivers and tanks are indicated by the color “blue.” and for trees, parks, and gardens, use “green.”. BGIhas numerous advantages and produces effects that cut across the economic, social, and environmental sectors. It contributes to the control of regional ecosystems as well as the reduction of pollutants and urban temperature. These in turn have a significant economic impact, for instance, terrace gardens encourage lower building surface temperatures, which reduces the need for cooling and, consequently, the demand for energy and power. Reduced consumption of vital raw materials and resources, the prevention of pollution, and a decrease in carbon emissions are further financial and economic advantages. This chapter reviews the applicability of BGIs in achieving SDGs at the ground level and further highlights the implications, benefits, and challenges of their implementation. It is known that an effective and efficient infrastructure like BGI allows multipurpose uses and several advantages that directly or indirectly help to meet the targets in order to achieve the SDGs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-62293-9_8;The concept of blue-green infrastructure (BGI), an essential integral componentforaliveable city, is relatively new and finds increasing attention in many cities andcountriesacrosstheglobe.Infrastructureplanningshouldbedesignedmore sensitively to ecological considerations by deploying more nature-driven solutions to address multiple challenges induced by rapid urbanization and climate emergencies in urban areas. BGI promotes an integrated and coordinated approach that integrates blue interventions (emphasizing the physicality of water itself) with green, which represents the network of land scape components including vegetation systems and water bodies helping to promote equity and resilience for sustainable urban futures. BGI are multifunctional and adaptable systems that integrate the principles of hydrology and ecology to design urban features that create win–win solutions for the environment, community and economy. Community participation which embraces the bottom-up approach engaging multiple stakeholders is crucial for effective and successful BGI adoptions. Incorporating the principles of BGI offers projected benefits, such as substantial improvement on water and air quality, mitigating the urban heat island effect, habitat protection, biodiversity conservation, positive impacts on health and well-being etc. The purpose of this chapter is to synthesize and review all successful BGI case studies at different scales across the globe to demonstrate that meaningful community participation is critical to improve BGI sustainability. The intent of this chapter to develop a framework based on the breadth of evidence to demonstrate how local community engagement, local knowledge, opinions and decision-making in BGI projects are recognised as being important for community well-being. This study may help policymakers, environmentalist, urban planners to better understand how the concept of nature-based landscape resilience can potentially help their decision making to prioritise and embrace a more holistic and social inclusive water sensitive urban planning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-62293-9_1;"Natural methods provide considerable potential for curtailment cities’ susceptibility to climate change and boosting their resilience by promoting the growth of blue and green urban region. Consequently, they may help mitigate the worst consequences of climate change and provide municipalities proactive possibilities for adaptation. We examine the numerous states in which nature-based solutions are pertinent for reducing climate alteration and adapting to it in urban environments, and we develop metrics for gauging their efficacy and corresponding knowledge gaps. We also examine current obstacles and prospective openings for expanding the scope and efficiency of the implementation of nature-based solutions (NbS). In this chapter, we emphasize three key necessarily for future scientific and policy agendas when addressing NbS: (1) create more convincing evidence for natural climate change adaptation and extenuation strategies and increase implementation to increase awareness; (2) Reflexive techniques, which comprise bringing together new networks of society, practitioners, and NbS ambassadors, can be used to adjust for governance issues in putting NbS into practice; (3) When implementing nature-based solutions, take into mind socio-environmental justice and societal cohesion by employing integrated governance strategies that take into account the integrative and transdisciplinary participation of different actors. Taking these requirements into account, NbS may act as tools for climate mitigation and adaptation that also enhance societal well-being, making them excellent choices for investments in sustainable urban development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."

10.3390/su152416854;Scholars have sought to integrate sustainable principles, attitudes, and methodologies into urban development, drawing insights from the natural and social sciences as well as historical contexts. However, current sustainable urban planning (SUP) research has a broad scope, unclear boundaries, and an absence of systematic literature reviews. To fill this research gap, this review presents a visual analysis of 38,344 publications on SUP indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) from 1964 to 2023, with the aim of detailing the trajectory of SUP research. Utilizing data retrieval and scientific metrology techniques, we: (1) Identified distinct phases in SUP research: budding (pre-1990s), exploration (1990s), foundation (2000s), and maturation (2010–present). (2) Discovered that publications predominantly focused on urban research, landscape architecture, and ecological studies, with publishing trends favoring developed, highly urbanized, and coastal nations. (3) Employed visualized dual map overlays, co-citation clustering networks, and keyword statistical charts to construct a knowledge framework of the interdisciplinary progression and thematic shifts in SUP. Key knowledge clustering included ‘community planning’, ‘urban expansion’, ‘ecosystem services’, and ‘nature-based solutions’. (4) Described the progression of SUP, green innovation is the most promising direction for future research. (5) Defined its scope and elements and advocated for three foundational principles: equity and justice, value articulations, and practical needs, offering a path to actualize SUP efforts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Following the heat equity concept, UHIs disproportionately impact disadvantaged or overburdened communities. Green infrastructure (GI) has been at the forefront of UHI mitigation efforts, including nature-based solutions like parks, pervious open spaces, wooded areas, green roofs, rain gardens, and shade trees. In this paper, we use a heat equity lens to analyze community perceptions of the intersection of climate change, UHI, and GI in Camden, New Jersey—a post-industrial city with a history of environmental injustices. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of survey responses (n = 107), 11 years of relevant X (formerly Twitter) posts (n = 367), and geospatial data, we present community perceptions of and connections between climate change, UHI, and GI and discuss major themes that emerged from the data: perceived heat inequity in Camden triggers negative emotions; a public knowledge gap exists regarding climate change-UHI-GI connections; and perceived inequitable distribution of GI and certain GI planning and maintenance practices may negatively impact UHI mitigation strategies. We argue these themes are useful to urban planners and relevant professionals while planning for heat equity and mitigating UHI effects in disadvantaged urban communities like Camden. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.5751/ES-14579-280429;As cities attempt to ameliorate urban green inequities, a potential challenge has emerged in the form of green gentrification. Although practitioners are central to urban greening and associated gentrification, there has yet to be an exploration of practitioner perspectives on the phenomenon. We fill this gap with an online survey of 51 urban greening practitioners in Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area. Most respondents defined green gentrification as the displacement of vulnerable residents due to the installation or improvement of green space that attracts wealthy in-movers and increases property values. They were most likely to identify greening as driving green gentrification, with a minority identifying other systemic drivers with greening in a secondary role. Although 39 of 51 participants had some familiarity with green gentrification, most reported low confidence in their understanding of the concept, little evidence of using the concept in their work, and moderate concern that their work is implicated in green gentrification. The gentrification issues most encountered by practitioners were changes to neighbourhood character and uneven investment in public infrastructure, and those working in domains linked to planning, equity, and engagement were most likely to encounter gentrification issues. Practitioners experienced multiple barriers to addressing green gentrification, including limited institutional capacity, limited access to data and relevant information, policy/mandate restriction, and lack of engagement tools. Results indicate that practitioners have a moderate understanding of green gentrification but do not often use the concept in their work, despite their potential to contribute to or exacerbate it. This suggests some resistance to critiques of urban greening practice, a failure of scholarly critiques of urban greening to influence policy change, and the need for stronger research theory and research co-creation involving practitioners and academia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

10.1016/j.scs.2023.104910;Resilience is a widely debated concept that encompasses various interpretations and definitions. Recently, in science and policy circles, there has been a growing interest in the concept of Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) resilience which offers a new interpretation. While this concept is now used frequently, it is not properly understood and there is still a lack of clarity on what it means and its underpinning principles. This lack of clarity and understanding may confuse and even disorient researchers and policy makers. To address this issue, we review the literature published in the context of urban systems. The reviewed literature is mainly focused on nature-based solutions, indicating more contributions from the ecological field. Also, flooding, extreme heat, and drought are major stressors discussed in the literature. We elaborate on the definition of SETS resilience and discuss that its dominant principles are adaptability, transformability, flexibility, redundancy, equity, diversity, foresight capacity, connectivity, robustness, multi-functionality, learning, and non-linearity. We also expound upon the key components of SETS, how they are intertwined, and potential trade-offs that may emerge between them. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of the SETS approach leads to numerous ancillary benefits. These include benefits for climate change adaptation and mitigation, pandemic prevention and response, human health and well-being, and justice. If multi-level and polycentric governance strategies are adopted, it can also help avoid trade-offs that may emerge between social, ecological, and technological dimensions. We conclude by emphasizing that the literature is dominated by epistemological approaches and more empirical research is needed to understand better the complex dynamics of SETS resilience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165824;The knowledge derived from successful case studies can act as a driver for the implementation and upscaling of nature-based solutions (NBS). This work reviewed 547 case studies to gain an overview of NBS practices and their role in reducing the adverse impact of natural hazards and climate change. The majority (60 %) of case studies are situated in Europe compared with the rest of the world where they are poorly represented. Of 547 case studies, 33 % were green solutions followed by hybrid (31 %), mixed (27 %), and blue (10 %) approaches. Approximately half (48 %) of these NBS interventions were implemented in urban (24 %), and river and lake (24 %) ecosystems. Regarding the scale of intervention, 92 % of the case studies were operationalised at local (50 %) and watershed (46 %) scales while very few (4 %) were implemented at the landscape scale. The results also showed that 63 % of NBS have been used to deal with natural hazards, climate change, and loss of biodiversity, while the remaining 37 % address socio-economic challenges (e.g., economic development, social justice, inequality, and cohesion). Around 88 % of NBS implementations were supported by policies at the national level and the rest 12 % at local and regional levels. Most of the analysed cases contributed to Sustainable Development Goals 15, 13, and 6, and biodiversity strategic goals B and D. Case studies also highlighted the co-benefits of NBS: 64 % of them were environmental co-benefits (e.g., improving biodiversity, air and water qualities, and carbon storage) while 36 % were social (27 %) and economic (9 %) co-benefits. This synthesis of case studies helps to bridge the knowledge gap between scientists, policymakers, and practitioners, which can allow adopting and upscaling of NBS for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and enhance their preference in decision-making processes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1680/icemge.66816.0141;"This chapter describes how geotechnical engineers can contribute to sustainable development. Climate change and environmental degradation, together with social and economic inequalities are among the biggest threats to humankind and the planet. Ensuring that sustainable development is at the heart of every decision made as geotechnical engineers and that design and construction contributes towards environmental regeneration and social equity is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing engineering in the twenty-first century. Geotechnical engineers need to play their part to make geotechnical practice sustainable and actively question whether their projects deliver outcomes that satisfy the triple bottom line: environmental, social and economic sustainability. This chapter cannot cover the full field of sustainability and geotechnics in any significant depth, but rather signposts the reader to where to find more information. Sustainable development in the context of geotechnical engineering includes minimising carbon emissions and other environmental impacts from construction; preserving and restoring biodiversity through use of regenerative and nature-based solutions; maintaining water quality and minimising its use; preserving topsoils and enabling carbon sequestration in soil; minimising use of natural resources and greater use of circular economy; and developing resilient geotechnical solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.envres.2023.116891;"Background: The GoGreenRoutes project aims to introduce co-created nature-based solutions (NBS) to enhance environmental quality in six medium-sized cities (Burgas, Lahti, Limerick, Tallinn, Umeå, and Versailles). We estimated the mortality and economic impacts attributed to suboptimal exposure to green space and air pollution, economic impacts, and the distribution thereof the adult population by socioeconomic status. Methods: We retrieved data from publicly accessible databases on green space (NDVI and % Green Area), air pollution (NO<inf>2</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and population (?20 years, n = 804,975) at a 250m × 250m grid-cell level, and mortality for each city for 2015. We compared baseline exposures at the grid-cell to World Health Organization's recommendations and guidelines. We applied a comparative risk assessment to estimate the mortality burden attributable to not achieving the recommendations and guidelines. We estimated attributable mortality distributions and the association with income levels. Results: We found high variability in air pollution and green spaces levels. Around 60% of the population lacked green space and 90% were exposed to harmful air pollution. Overall, we estimated age-standardized mortality rates varying from 10 (Umeå) to 92 (Burgas) deaths per 100,000 persons attributable to low NDVI levels; 3 (Lahti) to 38 (Burgas) per 100,000 persons to lack of % Green Area; 1 (Umeå) to 88 (Tallinn) per 100,000 persons to exceedances of NO<inf>2</inf> guidelines; and 1 (Umeå) to 206 (Burgas) per 100,000 persons to exceedances of PM<inf>2.5</inf> guidelines. Lower income associated with higher or lower mortality impacts depending on whether deprived populations lived in the densely constructed, highly-trafficked city centre or greener, less polluted outskirts. Conclusions: We attributed a considerable mortality burden to lack of green spaces and higher air pollution, which was unevenly distributed across different social groups. NBS and health-promoting initiatives should consider socioeconomic aspects to regenerate urban areas while providing equally good environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128120;"Systems-based frameworks offer a promising opportunity to integrate smart and green city approaches to create positive contributions to urban sustainability. In particular, digital public participatory GIS (PPGIS) presents a tool for combining technological approaches to urban planning with an agenda for more just nature-based solutions (NBS) by elucidating community voices and subjective perspectives. In this study, we investigate the potential for PPGIS to support more just and inclusive planning and implementation of NBS in a marginalized housing area (Hørgården) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Combining digital PPGIS with qualitative approaches, we identify residents’ meaningful places, narratives about community priorities and needs, and relational values expressed therein. We identify three key findings: (1) an absence of demographic difference in meaningful places identified in Hørgården; (2) a core-periphery structure in the presence of relational value and distribution of sites identified as unsafe or in need of care that is the inverse of that found in Danish policy discourse, and (3) the essential role of qualitative, community-engaged, and reflexive approaches to PPGIS in deriving these results. Based on these findings we conclude that smart technologies like digital PPGIS, framed within systems-based approaches and utilized in locally sensitive and responsive ways, can contribute to more just NBS for sustainable cities by connecting local neighborhood experience to municipal planning and policy agendas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1111/csp2.13028;The U.S. needs a National Biodiversity Strategy (hereafter Strategy). As a nation that places a high value on domestic biodiversity and on being a global leader in biodiversity conservation, the U.S. is failing to live up to its expectations regarding a national Strategy. A Strategy should suggest both legislation and policies and guide our country toward achieving stated objectives. We first propose a process to create a Strategy that involves establishing a government task force and supporting expert advisory panel. We then identify five key elements of a Strategy. First, a Strategy should identify priorities among legislation that impacts biodiversity. At present, conflicting rules lead to administrative uncertainty and inconsistent decisions. Second, a Strategy should create a comprehensive vision for societal participation in biodiversity protection. Current practices comprise a mixture of different levels of commitment to stakeholder participation and social justice. Third, a Strategy should mandate periodic review to better provide the American public a synopsis of how we are faring with our treasured biodiversity. Fourth, a Strategy should be as comprehensive and broad as biodiversity itself, spanning organizational ranges from genes to ecosystems. Finally, a Strategy should provide a structure for achievement that incentivizes public and business and that stimulates innovation, particularly in nature-based solutions to complex environmental challenges. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107949;Cities, as the human habitat of the 21st century, will increasingly face climate change-related risks. Extreme weather events, hot spells, and rising air pollution already have widespread impacts on people, affecting their health and well-being. Urban vegetation is a proposed nature-based solution to address these challenges. However, the equitable distribution of urban vegetation is not always ensured. The study applies two innovative segregation-based inequality indices, recently developed by Schaeffer and Tivadar (2019), which reference to the residential segregation literature as a source of insight for the measurement of environmental inequalities within urban areas. Using high-resolution satellite data and demographic data on a 250 m2 grid level, this study is able to deliver robust evidence on the existence of environmental inequalities with respect to ethnic minorities and urban vegetation. It is observed that minorities consistently experience higher levels of segregation from urban vegetation compared to non-minorities, even when accounting for interactions with wider neighbourhoods. Additionally, the application of a Jackknife simulation provides insights for local policy interventions, mapping hotspots of urban inequalities and provides a solid starting point to tackle these issues on the ground. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104866;There is a large body of research on the benefits green spaces offer city dwellers and how people use urban green spaces (UGS). However, there is much less information on how many people do not use UGS, who these people are, and why they resign from going there. This paper focuses on understanding reasons that restrict the use of UGS and draws the socio-economic and demographic profile of UGS non-users. For this purpose, we surveyed N = 10,391 respondents from 33 European countries (statistically representative at the country level). Results show that about 10% of the respondents do not use UGS. However, the share of non-users differs between countries from 2% (Turkey) to 25% (United Kingdom). Results reveal statistically significant differences between those who do not use and those who use UGS across age, education level, and residential location, demonstrating the importance of considering the needs of different groups of people when designing, planning and managing UGS. Lack of time and interest, and long distance from where people live are key limiting factors. The dominant reasons for not using UGS enable us to group the countries using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering analysis. With this study, we contribute to the knowledge of personal barriers that prevent UGS use and, in particular, connect the different reasons for not using UGS with the socio-economic groups typically listed as deprived when it comes to UGS provision. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1111/anti.12932;Emissions trading and nature-based solutions, particularly REDD+, have lent themselves to the critical literature on the “socioecological fix” in neoliberal capital accumulation and state regulation. Prone to reversals, land conflict, and leakage, these mechanisms displace the burden of carbon emissions reductions to global South countries, promote new green commodities, and thus increase rather than curb the chance of capital accumulations by big polluters. Studies of existing REDD+ projects register the privatisation of forest management on the one hand and “aidification” on the other, suggesting impediments to fully commodifying forest carbon ranging from social movement resistance to technical issues. This case study of Brazil's national Amazon Fund points to global South protagonism in constructing and negotiating REDD+, challenging Northern and market hegemonies. Progressive Southern actors use the political space of the fix to defend rural communities' territorial rights and demand resources in line with historic responsibilities and climate justice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to understandings of NbS and colonialism through critical reflection, as well as provide tools for action to for researchers and practitioners. In settler-colonial contexts, NbS are colonizing by default. Colonialism operates through producing and growing power asymmetries, which exist in NbS research and practice. These power asymmetries are perpetuated and accelerated by settler NbS practitioners and researchers. However, knowledge co-production that embodies ethical space principles with Indigenous partners in NbS may support power redistribution.

10.1002/pan3.10498;Adapting to and mitigating against climate change requires the protection and expansion of natural carbon sinks, especially ecosystems with exceptional carbon density such as mangrove forests (an example of ‘blue carbon’). Projects that do this are called ‘nature-based solutions’ (NbS). International norms regulating NbS stipulate the importance of justice, in contrast with some of the history and practice in wider conservation. However, what justice means and how it manifests in practice remain contentious. Selling carbon credits on the voluntary market is a growing source of funding for NbS. A large literature examines the ethics, economics, science and politics of such payments for ecosystem services (PES), including for blue carbon. The interpretations of justice in this context are particularly contentious, but operational blue carbon projects have not been examined from a justice perspective. Here we report on a case study involving the first blue carbon project, Mikoko Pamoja, and its sister project Vanga Blue Forest, both based in Kenya. We consider how justice is conceived by local participants and beneficiaries, using interviews, focus groups and participant observation to collect data, as well as by international stakeholders and in relevant governing documents and policy. We compare these perceptions with expectations and critiques derived a priori from the literature, including a classic thought experiment that influential justice philosopher John Rawls called the ‘original position’. In contrast to high-level policy and much of the literature, but in common with Rawls, local stakeholders emphasised distributional aspects of justice. Locally situated interpretations of contentious issues such as elite capture and commodification differed markedly from common interpretations in the literature. Our work emphasises the importance of situating abstract concepts in their local contexts when evaluating justice in NbS projects. It shows how narratives advocating technical precision and economic efficiency in NbS can militate against transparency and agency at a local level and emphasises the critical importance of benefit sharing that is perceived to be fair.

10.1371/journal.pclm.0000194;Over the last decade, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for water management have gained traction as triple-win options for climate action due to their ability to address social, economic, and environmental challenges. Recent developments in the literature of NbS have resulted in a body of work addressing questions about knowledge and justice. In line with these developments, this paper proposes the Knowledge and Epistemic Injustice in NbS for Water Framework (KEIN Framework) to identify the production of epistemic injustices in the design of NbS for water management. The KEIN framework draws on questions about knowledge and power raised by Avelino and five mechanisms that lead to epistemic injustice based on work by Fricker and Byskov. We apply the framework to examine a proposal presented to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that included both NbS for water management and Indigenous People in South America. Rather than being an analysis of the project or the GCF per se, the goal of this analysis is to demonstrate the utility of the framework to analyze proposals during the design stage. We argue that proposals submitted to the GCF are reflective of a broadly held international environmental logic. We also identify indications that knowledge was organized and treated in a way that favored external actors at the expense of local actors. Our analysis also revealed prejudices against people’s epistemic capacities, with potential implications for how the generation of local knowledge is adopted on the ground. The framework illustrates how the design of NbS may minimally disrupt power relations due to the influential role of some actors in generating knowledge. This study contributes to the operationalization of epistemic justice in designing NbS. Through the application of the proposed framework, the study contributes to future work advancing the construction of epistemically just NbS. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.indic.2023.100290;As a vital component of urban green infrastructures, urban green space (UGS) provides essential ecological, recreational, and social-cultural services to urban residents. Ensuring adequate and equitable accessibility to UGS for all urban residents has become an integral aspect of promoting social justice. However, studies that comprehensively investigate the long-term changes in urban green space accessibility (UGSA) and its equity under rapid urbanization are scarce, thereby limiting the potential guidance for implementing nature-based solutions to enhance ecosystem services that benefit urban residents. In this study, taking Guangzhou, China, as the empirical study area, the UGSA and its equity during 2000–2015 were evaluated at the district level by combining the Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area method (Gaussian-based 2SFCA) and the Gini coefficient. Meanwhile, the changes in land cover and land use (LULC) were also investigated to reveal the dynamics of the UGS. Moreover, the long-term synchronous changes between UGSA and its equity were explored through a grouping analysis based on the four-quadrant method. The results revealed spatial heterogeneity in UGSA, with peri-urban districts having more accessibility to UGS compared to core-urban districts. The equity of UGSA exhibited an uneven spatial pattern, with most districts displaying consistently low levels of equality. The results of grouping analysis underscored the significance of considering both the improvements of UGSA and its equity in policy-making, leading to specific policy implications for each district. Our study provides valuable insights that can inform future urban spatial greening strategies and contribute to the promotion of sustainable urban development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128067;The last decade has seen a profound increase in the development of assessment frameworks for ecosystem services, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions (NBS). This has improved understanding of NBS impact assessment, including processual aspects related to participatory planning and governance. We argue that, although representing a move in the right direction, NBS assessment frameworks would benefit from a broader framing of governance, including the role of government-led laws, policies and regulations along with community-led and collaborative multi-stakeholder initiatives. The consideration of marginalised communities and environmental justice should also be strengthened. To ensure a feasible and comprehensive approach to NBS governance assessment, we carried out a systematic literature review on the topic of urban NBS governance. Using thematic analysis, we developed a framework of five themes encompassing nine governance dimensions, of which some are further broken down into sub-dimensions. To assess the different NBS governance dimensions, we developed a tool in the format of a survey for urban decision-makers and other stakeholders, encompassing nine urban NBS governance indicators corresponding with the identified dimensions. Further to complementing NBS governance assessment approaches in important ways, we were able to highlight knowledge gaps around integrating features of the planning process and community-based or traditional knowledge. Our tool for monitoring urban NBS governance is simple to use and provides cities with a low-cost and comprehensive approach for monitoring and evaluating their readiness for mainstreaming NBS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2023.128065;"To address the current and future impacts of climate change on urban inhabitants, the development and benefits of urban green areas have been widely investigated – including parks, open unsealed spaces, residential gardens and street trees. However, the provision of urban green spaces can be used by private developers or private-public partnerships as a marketing tool to increase real-estate values. This presents a disadvantage for low-income households who may not be able to stay where they are or move to buildings or areas less affected by heat waves. Another key challenge reflects land-use conflicts created by the need to plant more trees, as opposed to other urban needs such as more parking spaces. At present, in several cities, policy and planning instruments remain inadequate in providing enough green spaces such as urban trees to lessen the heat stress in cities (for example, in poorer neighborhoods and new urban transformations led by private developers). The need for the proliferation of urban trees faces multiple expectations and challenges from several perspectives: 1) the crucial need for adaptation to climate change; 2) the partial presence (or total absence) of trees in areas undergoing densification and future transformations to readdress within effective planning strategies and tools; and 3) the relevance of social consequences (counteracting socio-spatial inequalities and considering residents’ perspectives) linked to green gentrification and environmental justice. The aim of this paper is to investigate these three perspectives (which are currently independent, for the most part), in order to interlink the silos and address the need for an interdisciplinary perspective of trees in urban areas. We suggest that the integration of these three aspects would help us fill the current knowledge gaps and enable a comprehensive perspective on social and environmental policies required in the complex urban system, and therefore also encourage new research paths, as well as a higher social acceptance by homeowners and renters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104781;Green infrastructure is an increasingly popular urban sustainability strategy, widely promoted for its ability to provide multiple benefits. We examined 120 planning documents from 19 U.S. cities to identify if and how the stated benefits that cities use within their rationales for green infrastructure programs (rationale statements) align with the criteria used to site green infrastructure at the neighborhood scale (siting statements). Our findings suggest that many of the desired benefits stated in the rationales for green infrastructure lack corresponding and specific siting criteria. This was particularly evident for rationale statements concerning social and cultural ecosystem services, seemingly because certain benefits, especially those related to stormwater management, are prioritized over other green infrastructure services. While multiple benefits remain a dominant rationale for green infrastructure in the cities analyzed, including stormwater management, social cohesion, and biodiversity benefits, siting criteria were dominated by stormwater management, available locations, and other logistical considerations. These findings indicate a large-scale misalignment between the multifunctional ideal of urban green infrastructure and the procedures used to implement green infrastructure programs. We conclude with a discussion of how siting criteria and processes can be elaborated to deliver the desired benefits of green infrastructure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1111/cobi.14086;Despite a common understanding of the harmful impacts of Western conservation models that separate people from nature, widespread progress toward incorporating socioeconomic, political, cultural, and spiritual considerations in conservation practice is lacking. For some, the concept of nature-based solutions (NbS) is seen as an interdisciplinary and holistic pathway to better integrate human well-being in conservation. We examined how conservation practitioners in the United States view NbS and how social considerations are or are not incorporated in conservation adaptation projects. We interviewed 28 individuals working on 15 different such projects associated with the Wildlife Conservation Society's Climate Adaptation Fund. We completed 2 rounds of iterative coding in NVivo 12.6.1 to identify in the full text of all interview responses an a priori set of themes related to our research questions and emergent themes. Many respondents saw this moment as a tipping point for the field (one in which the perceived values of social considerations are increasing in conservation practice) (76%) and that social justice concerns and the need to overcome racist and colonial roots of Western conservation have risen to the forefront. Respondents also tentatively agreed that NbS in conservation could support social and ecological outcomes for conservation, but that it was far from guaranteed. Despite individual intention and awareness among practitioners to incorporate social considerations in conservation practice, structural barriers, including limited funding and inflexible grant structures, continue to constrain systemic change. Ultimately, systemic changes that address power and justice in policy and practice are required to leverage this moment to more fully address social considerations in conservation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1002/sd.2510;Funding and financing challenges remain a persistent barrier to implementing nature-based solutions that enhance ecosystem services, facilitate adaptation to climate change, and combat environmental stressors in cities. In the absence of adequate public financial resources, private funds are often expected to fill the gap. But market-driven, nature-based solutions can contribute to an inequitable distribution of urban ecosystem services by focusing on net benefits provided by nature. To help foster sustainable development and ensure that nature-based solutions reach diverse and historically marginalized populations and communities, this scoping review explores the ecosystem services provided by nature-based solutions and the payment mechanisms that produce and maintain them, focusing on literature on the United States. Findings suggest that the net benefits provided by nature-based solutions and the available payment mechanisms vary based on the solution utilized (e.g., urban trees, parks, community gardens). Further, the distribution of benefits from nature-based solutions is influenced by local historical, cultural, political, economic, and environmental contexts, the voices included in decision-making, and the payment mechanisms used. Inspired by social equity principles, we present a framework for ecosystem service provision that is sensitive to market-driven funding, financing, and partnerships. Practitioners can use this framework to assess whether payment schemes work in tandem with place (the local context) and process (governance and planning approaches) to ameliorate or exacerbate disparities in nature-based solutions and the benefits they provide to people. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1017/cft.2023.22;Although coasts are frequently seen as at the frontline of near-future environmental risk, there is more to the understanding of the future of coastal environments than a simple interaction between increasing hazards (particularly related to global sea level rise) and increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal populations. The environment is both multi-hazard and regionally differentiated, and coastal populations, in what should be seen as a coupled social-ecological-physical system, are both affected by, and themselves modify, the impact of coastal dynamics. As the coupled dance between human decisions and coastal environmental change unfolds over the coming decades, transdisciplinary approaches will be required to come to better decisions on identifying and following sustainable coastal management pathways, including the promotion of innovative restoration activities. Inputs from indigenous knowledge systems and local communities will be particularly important as these stakeholders are crucial actors in the implementation of ecosystem-based mitigation and adaptation strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.04.016;Urban climate adaptation through nature-based solutions (NBS) requires collective action that incorporates spatial justice considerations. Collective actions reveal new ways of thinking about urban green commons and spatial justice by reframing conventional understandings of NBS, space, and climate adaptation. Three urban green commons examined in Istanbul demonstrate how the grassroots-supported NBS must navigate complex land ownership arrangements, spatial justice, and opposing urban development priorities and socio-spatial reconfigurations spurred by local and national political elites. Using qualitative data collected from fieldwork carried out in 2019, we find critical relationships between activists, academics, professional organizations, and local residents collectively acting to promote urban green commons. NBS do not rely on the dominant techno-political processes that generate primarily infrastructure-based climate adaptation solutions in Istanbul. While spatial justice and collective action scholarship often pays attention to how disadvantaged communities gain recognition and involvement in decision making - such as establishing formal channels to access environmental goods and services - climate adaptation through NBS opens spaces of opportunity for these groups to promote justice and resist the dominant economic development paradigm. Further studies must pay attention to what extent collective actions create new socio-political identities that are harnessed to resist dominant techno-political processes, and when are these emergent identities co-opted by local and national governments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.02.022;Social housing typically encompasses neighbourhoods with low social-economic status. Here, environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss have a higher impact than in other neighbourhoods. Applying Nature-based Solutions (NbS) may enhance the resilience of social housing neighbourhoods and as such make cities more just. In this article we explore to what extent NbS can be applied, given the physical, social and financial limitations that define Dutch social housing practice, and - by doing so – what NbS can contribute to environmental justice. Based upon several Living Lab experiences and dialogues with numerous housing corporations, ten NbS measures have been identified that likely will match with current practices in social housing. Implementing NbS contributes to all aspects of environmental justice, with distributional justice as the most straightforward one (more NbS means more environmental benefits). Procedural and recognitional justice were found to be of crucial importance to make greenspaces worthwhile for the residents. Our study draws attention to the fact that NbS knowledge is key but currently still insufficient, both within housing corporations as within the key partners (local authorities, landscaping firms). This means that there is a growing demand to increase NbS knowledge in the social housing sector. We finalize this article with recommendations on how to meet this demand. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
x;As nations scramble to reduce and offset their greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, and corporations do the same for their own reasons, voluntary carbon markets flourish and demand for nature-based carbon credits outpaces supplies. Global attention is on countries with substantial potential to generate certifiable forest-based carbon credits. Despite nearly 30-years of experience with carbon offset projects, forest-based climate change mitigation projects of questionable quality still proliferate in Malaysia and elsewhere. Here, we assess the feasibility and sustainability of the Nature Conservation Agreement (NCA) – a recent project that includes two million hectares of protected forest in the Malaysian state of Sabah. We use this seriously flawed example to identify five key issues that forest carbon projects should not ignore: transparency, additionality, social equity, sovereignty, and complementarity. We also suggest how all five issues could be mitigated by use of a jurisdictional approach to forest carbon project development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cosust.2023.101297;There is potential for nature-based solutions (NbS) to contribute to climate-resilient development (CRD) due to their integrated approach to mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development. However, despite alignment between NbS and CRD's objectives, realization of this potential is not guaranteed. A CRD pathways (CRDP) approach helps to analyze the complexities of the relationship between CRD and NbS, and a climate justice lens enables the identification of the multiple ways that NbS can support or undermine CRD by foregrounding the politics inherent in deciding between NbS trade-offs. We use stylized vignettes of potential NbS to examine how the dimensions of climate justice reveal the potential of NbS to contribute to CRDP. We consider tensions in NbS projects between local and global climate objectives, and the potential for NbS framing to reinforce inequalities or unsustainable practices. Ultimately, we present a framework that combines climate justice and CRDP in an analytical tool for understanding the potential for a NbS to support CRD in specific places. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.02.021;Discussions about just transitions and nature-based solutions (NBS) often articulate an essentialist sense of place perspective that emphasises stasis through combinations of belonging, rootedness, continuity, attachment and connections among sites, scales and subjectivities. In response, we demonstrate how a progressive understanding of “senses” of place that embraces fluid place meanings accessible at different temporal and spatial scales enables a new understanding of the interface between structural and emotional transformation of place, as well as rethinking of just urban transitions. We present four transformation modalities that reconsider people-place, people-nature, and people-institutional relations pertinent to environmental justice and use case examples to demonstrate their relevance to NBS planning. We conclude by offering two overarching principles for urban policy, planning, and governance for fostering just transitions through NBS. First, NBS planning needs to purposively activate structural and emotional transformations through experimentation to enhance procedural justice. Second, NBS co-design and implementation should consider the dynamic interplay between recognition and distribution justice to engage multiple senses of place. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su15107957;The issue of spatial equity of Nature-Based Solutions in cities generally concerns the spatial distribution of their benefits to local residents and other city users. In the context of flood risk management, planners are challenged to identify effective mitigation and adaptation measures that can generate benefits to the higher number of people and, more specifically, to people with highest levels of exposure and vulnerability. To address these issues, an essential step is to identify the geography of needs for mitigation, intended as prior areas in which to locate measures for flood risk mitigation. This study combines geospatial layers of multiple dimensions of exposure and vulnerability to flooding and identifies prior areas suitable for design scenarios for mitigation of flooding risk, for a regional case study located in Sicily. The results show patterns of exposure and vulnerability that vary according to locally relevant physical and social urban dimensions. Based on these results, proposals for mitigation actions are advanced with the overall objective of generating equal benefits to the most vulnerable exposed social subjects. Moreover, this study argues about the particular implications of implementing stormwater green infrastructure planning for equal beneficial distribution of the potentially achievable risk reduction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.02.023;Cities are under intensifying pressure to respond to climate change and growing social inequities. Integrating nature-based solutions, as part of essential city infrastructure, contributes to resilient, liveable and equitable cities, as well as provision of biodiversity habitat. There is increasing focus on how concepts of justice can be embedded in these planning and governance processes. This paper proposes a framework to inform planning for just nature-based cities. It brings together concepts of just city, environmental and climate justice and more-than-human thinking, with research on urban nature-based solutions. It highlights the centrality of epistemic justice, and the importance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in just nature-based city planning and governance. The just nature-based city framework is applied to the case study of the Yarra River (Melbourne, Australia). In 2017, the Yarra River Protection (Wilip-gin Birrarung murron) Act, the first legislation in Australia to be co-titled in the Traditional Owners’ language, legally recognised the river as a single living and integrated natural entity. Applying the just nature-based city framework, we find that there are both opportunities and challenges in this new approach to planning. While the Act and associated programs represent substantial and innovative advances, their scope is limited by exclusion of key policy domains and a focus on waterway corridor rather than catchment. The paper concludes by reinforcing the importance of a broadened understanding of justice, that spans both human and non-human considerations, and foregrounds Traditional Owners’ perspectives and aspirations in designing, planning and governing just nature-based cities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.02.017;"Within the context of climate change and the quest for more sustainable cities, greener urban solutions are gaining traction through emerging concepts that have been orienting municipalities’ regeneration and development agendas, including the so-called nature-based solutions (NbS), which have been discussed, planned, and proposed worldwide by academics, NGOs, and policymakers. Comprising different scales and typologies, NbS makes up a modern toolkit of actions towards decarbonized, climate-resilient, and ecologically healthy cities, claiming ample ecological, social, and economic benefits. A literature analysis indicates a greater presence of research and projects focused on NbS in countries in the Global North than in the South; however, given their accelerated urban growth, lack of green areas, and degradation of local environments, cities of the South urgently need such solutions. Nonetheless, research on the effects of urban greening agendas in the Global North has demonstrated that solutions may be entangled with neoliberal practices of space production that exacerbate inequalities, resulting in harmful social impacts such as displacement of people and increases in land and housing costs. This study seeks to build an anticipatory understanding of practices that articulate NbS in the Global South from a Brazilian viewpoint. Given Brazil's reality of social and environmental injustices, we focus on whether implementing NbS could amplify such problems. Our objective is to contribute to the debate by (1) understanding how the NbS concept is being appropriated, in practice, in Brazil, and (2) reflecting and pointing out paths and recommendations on how to plan NbS through a justice lens. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1038/s41893-022-01036-x;Many cities around the world are experimenting with nature-based solutions (NbS) to address the interconnected climate-, biodiversity- and society-related challenges they are facing (referred to as the climate–biodiversity–society, or CBS, nexus), by restoring, protecting and more sustainably managing urban ecosystems. Although the application of urban NbS is flourishing, there is little synthesized evidence clarifying the contribution of NbS in addressing the intertwined CBS challenges and their capacity to encourage transformational change in urban systems worldwide. We map and analyse NbS approaches specifically for climate change adaptation across 216 urban interventions and 130 cities worldwide. Results suggest that current NbS practices are limited in how they may comprehensively address CBS challenges, particularly by accounting for multidimensional forms of climate vulnerability, social justice, the potential for collaboration between public and private sectors and diverse cobenefits. Data suggest that knowledge and practice are biased towards the Global North, under-representing key CBS challenges in the Global South, particularly in terms of climate hazards and urban ecosystems involved. Our results also point out that further research and practice are required to leverage the transformative potential of urban NbS. We provide recommendations for each of these areas to advance the practice of NbS for transformative urban adaptation within the CBS nexus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1111/jiec.13369;Resource-use patterns may entail systemic risks and cascade effects, which consequently inhibit the ability to deliver socioeconomic services. Identifying resource-use patterns exhibiting systemic risks and reshaping their combinations is a potential lever in realizing the transition to a sustainable, resilient, and resource-secure system. Using an island context to assess the quantity and composition of resource throughput enables a more comprehensive analysis of these risks. This article presents the first mass-balance account of socio-metabolic flows for The Bahamas in 2018, to identify socio-metabolic risks and cascading effects. Socio-metabolic risks are systemic risks related to critical resource availability, material circulation integrity, and (in)equities in cost and benefit distributions. We utilize the economy-wide material flow accounting framework to map the material flow patterns across the economy. In 2018, annual direct material input was estimated at 9.4 t/cap/yr, of which 60% were imports. High masses of waste (1.4 t/cap/yr) remained unrecovered due to the lack of recycling. Total domestic extraction (DE) were dominated by non-metallic minerals with more than 80%, while marine biomass makes up barely 1% of total DE. Due to its linear, undiversified metabolism, and heavy imports dependency, the system is susceptible to socio-metabolic risks and cascading effects including low levels of self-sufficiency, high vulnerability to shocks, commodity price fluctuations, threats to sensitive ecosystems, health impacts, and economic losses, among others. A holistic resource management strategy and nature-based solutions that consider the trade-offs and synergies between different resource-use patterns are critical when exploring potential plans for metabolic risk reduction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land12030604;Self-constructed cities refer to impoverished neighborhoods that suffer from inadequate housing. Such cities are the result of individual or communal initiatives that must self-construct their neighborhoods. Most of the self-constructed cities are located near endangered bioregions on the Earth, and their continued growth will inevitably aggravate the human impact on our planet. Dwellers in these areas tackle threats such as poverty, environmental degradation, and disaster vulnerability. The lack of knowledge in planning self-constructed cities causes conditions of injustice. However, appropriate management of the existing natural capital of the surrounding areas of such cities can address the mentioned challenges and the conditions for justice. This paper aims to evaluate the role of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) in planning procedures, to create conditions of fairness and equity in self-constructed cities. The paper focused on the linkage between the application of NBS and four principles of justice: distributive justice, restorative justice, spatial justice, and interactional justice. Considering data from a review of the literature, scrutiny of past planning and policy measures and a field study with interviews with stakeholders, the empirical result of our study delineates important strategic implications of Nature-Based Solutions for sustainable planning in the case study of San José de Chamanga, Ecuador. It was demonstrated how small-scale, natural-based interventions, instead of broader actions based on a pure engineering perspective, are economically and ecologically profitable, with a positive impact on local communities’ well-being and social cohesion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2023.01.008;"This study explores the gap between theoretical frameworks of Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and current NbS interventions. Despite the existence of well-established definitions and practical tools, there are still organizations that implement NbS according to their own interpretations, creating gaps in the way practitioners apply these solutions. Four main gaps were identified: Framing of priorities to address an outcome, measurability and effectiveness of interventions, alignment with transformational governance processes, and understanding of trade-offs. By collecting the perception of NbS practitioners mainly focused on Africa, Europe, Latin America through a structured online survey, the results showed that five main ideas can help close these gaps: (1) designing NbS to address local problems that subsequently address societal challenges may be a more effective framing than targeting interventions to societal challenges that may not capture local stakeholder priorities; (2) interventions should consider both qualitative and quantitative impact-oriented indicators to learn from practice, and establish robust interventions and confidence in NbS; (3) transformative NbS processes must incorporate pluralistic assessment in interventions, attending to distributive, recognition, and procedural justice; (4) systemic socioeconomic and institutional barriers are not exclusively within the power of practitioners to fix but they must be addressed to achieve transformative NbS processes; (5) certain types of governance, scale, and cost-benefit trade-offs may not be fully understood and remain elusive, but they are still important to identify, to integrate and negotiate trade-offs in NbS implementation. We urge NbS practitioners and formulators of the concept to consider these ideas when implementing NbS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117050;Urban ecosystem services (UES), as an important concept in nature-based solutions, can effectively mitigate adverse environmental burdens and have great potential in addressing environmental justice issues. However, few studies linking UES with environmental justice have considered both supply and demand sides of UES, particularly at the spatial scale of residential walking space. Against this backdrop, we investigated the distributional justice of supply and demand for urban cooling, flood mitigation, air purification, and outdoor recreation in residential walking spaces in Shanghai among socially vulnerable groups (i.e., elderly residents, children, females, low-income residents, no-hukou residents, and ethnic minorities). We found that (1) the UES supply of residential walking space was much lower than that of non-residential walking space, while the UES demand was much higher than that of non-residential walking space. (2) Higher proportions of ethnic minorities, no-hukou residents, and females in Shanghai were positively correlated with several UES demands but were not positively correlated with ES supply, indicating a higher possibility of unsatisfied UES demand for these disadvantaged groups. Future urban blue-green space planning should pay more attention to the spatial allocation of blue-green space, especially placing more blue-green space around residential walking spaces with high UES demand and with a high proportion of socially disadvantaged groups. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.11.020;"The Latin American region has been marked by a historic process of extractivism and weak institutional structures, causing deep socio-environmental and economic crises. The resaturation of territorial justice has then become the center of the debate. Nature-based solutions, for their innovative and systemic nature, could be key in approaching these complex problems. However, the interplay between these strategies and justice is not clear enough. This article addresses this interaction centering on protected areas, the most traditional response from regional governments to nature degradation. We attempt to test the hypothesis that integrating protected areas in land use planning policies improves the exercise of justice, understanding it from a place-based point of view. To this end, we carried out quali- and quantitative analysis of social perceptions, historical background, land use policies and governance in Tandil and Tornquist, two municipal districts of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results showed that i) protected areas were associated with justice if a conservation project reached a legal rule and if the community was involved in its formulation and management; ii) the integration of protected areas in land use planning policies helped to satisfy both conditions. We end by proposing a theoretical model which outlines how three strengths of land use planning can turn PAs into more just NbS. We also discuss the need to develop a broader and place-based approach of justice as “territorial justice”. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/978-3-031-25110-8_133;The growing environmental pressure characterized by climate change, loss of biodiversity, and increasing disasters (floods, droughts, heat waves, and so on) along with emerging infectious diseases and especially the COVID-19 pandemic “Social Justice and Covid-19” and “COVID-19 and Social Impact” are the results of unsustainable development, where different crises interplay with one another. This stimulates and evolves governments and scientific communities to rethink the concept of resilience and the distribution of responsibility between different urban actors. During the last decades, the concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) and their implementation in the urban context gained increased attention in sustainability science and resilience theory. NBS involves nature and natural elements using an ecosystem-based approach and a concept of co-creation to address a variety of societal challenges while providing environmental benefits. This chapter examines the input of the NBS approach to resilience and sustainability research as well as the effectiveness of various NBS interventions toward achieving ecological, social, and economic outcomes and thus contributing to sustainability and resilience. The chapter aims at investigating how NBS can support the health and well-being of urban communities and how practitioners can plan, design, implement, and promote NBS, in particular, what social and cultural values are associated with NBS and what role play inter- and transdisciplinary approaches in this regard. It also discusses the synergies and trade-offs associated with NBS and in relation to NBS multifunctionality. For this purpose, the authors used a literature analysis, an assessment of Europe-wide NBS data and knowledge base, and a number of workshops and webinars developed and organized within NBS-related projects RECONECT and CONNECTING Nature. In many of the analyzed NBS cases, various participatory approaches are applied to highlight the value of co-creation concept and polycentric governance. The majority of them consider human well-being and social resilience as an integral factor in their projects, while having many environmental issues and SDGs in the background. Resilience to climate change dominates the discourse in such projects, and also the development of various strategies for addressing other sustainability and societal challenges with the help of nature toward making cities just, healthy, and resilient for their inhabitants are the key outcomes resulting from the presented NBS projects, from which structural analysis will be provided in the paper. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1073/pnas.2214334120;"Civil infrastructure will be essential to face the interlinked existential threats of climate change and rising resource demands while ensuring a livable Anthropocene for all. However, conventional infrastructure planning largely neglects the contributions and maintenance of Earth’s ecological life support systems, which provide irreplaceable services supporting human well-being. The stability and performance of these services depend on biodiversity, but conventional infrastructure practices, narrowly focused on controlling natural capital, have inadvertently degraded biodiversity while perpetuating social inequities. Here, we envision a new infrastructure paradigm wherein biodiversity and ecosystem services are a central objective of civil engineering. In particular, we reimagine infrastructure practice such that 1) ecosystem integrity and species conservation are explicit objectives from the outset of project planning; 2) infrastructure practices integrate biodiversity into diverse project portfolios along a spectrum from conventional to nature-based solutions and natural habitats; 3) ecosystem functions reinforce and enhance the performance and lifespan of infrastructure assets; and 4) civil engineering promotes environmental justice by counteracting legacies of social inequity in infrastructure development and nature conservation. This vision calls for a fundamental rethinking of the standards, practices, and mission of infrastructure development agencies and a broadening of scope for conservation science. We critically examine the legal and professional precedents for this paradigm shift, as well as the moral and economic imperatives for manifesting equitable infrastructure planning that mainstreams biodiversity and nature’s benefits to people. Finally, we set an applied research agenda for supporting this vision and highlight financial, professional, and policy pathways for achieving it. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3390/su15021598;Municipalities, their utilities and resource managers are designing and implementing policies and programs toward climate adaptation, which means governing urban water resources differently. Urban water managers are thus expanding their roles and responsibilities through the installation and maintenance of green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) systems. This system expansion is perhaps more striking for water utilities administering GSI-related programs because they acquire a role that has an impact on how residents and neighborhoods will differentially experience the effects of climate change. Through an in-depth qualitative study of a GSI program in Tucson, Arizona, USA, we contribute to the socio-environmental justice framework with specific attention to distributive, procedural, recognition, interactional, and mobility justice. We highlight that a socio-environmental justice approach requires resource managers and decision-makers to recognize and respect the ways in which people’s everyday relationship to water and water infrastructure is impacted by culturally mediated social norms and values, as well as legacies of exclusion and inclusion in urban development and resource governance. Thus, we argue that discussions around water equity in urban water governance need to be placed within a socio-environmental justice framework to address historical inequalities and ensure these are not reproduced through GSI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fenvs.2023.1218819;Climate adaptation policies have received attention in major due to the dual challenges of external factors like global warming, and internal factors related to the transition from rapid urbanization to sustainable development. However, previous research on heat or climate mitigation has often focused on external factors, neglecting the internal factors throughout the process of urban development and planning history. Research has revealed that city center where urban heat island phenomena is prominent, are subjected to external factors of intense heat exposure, as well as deeply influenced by the internal factors “urban development legacy.” An increasing body of research note that the inequitable legacy from urban development could impact environmental equity outcomes of cities. Based on this, we argue that urban heat mitigation research should adopt the perspective of the urban development process. We then utilize the Heat Mitigation Framework to examine the tangible outcomes of environmental equity over an extended period of urban development. This study focuses on the Charlotte city center that have undergone multiple processes of redlining policies and rapid urbanization, using a research framework for environmental equity-oriented urban heat management to examine whether a series of heat mitigation policies have effectively reduced heat exposure and whether they have truly benefited heat-vulnerable groups. Based on 20 years of multi-source heat exposure and urban spatial data, this paper provides evidence of ongoing enhancements to the heat exposure environment in the Charlotte city center. However, despite these improvements, heat vulnerable group that are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of heat exposure did not experience commensurate benefits. The conclusion of this article validates the ongoing trends of global sustainable studies in nature-based solutions and social-ecological systems, highlighting the issue of environmental equity evaluation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/B978-0-443-15274-0.50548-5;Global goals like “Net-zero”, “Nature-positive”, and “Socially Just” require human activities to reduce emissions, restore nature, and be socially equitable. This work proposes an approach that includes ecological capacity and social justice requirements to guide engineering decisions and designs. We utilize the supply and demand of ecosystem services to identify the safe and just operating space1,2. The ecologically safe space is determined by the multiscale framework of Techno-Ecological Synergy (TES). The degree of overshoot quantifies the absolute environmental sustainability (AES) at the relevant spatial scale3,4. For the socially just space, we calculate a minimum threshold of necessary goods and services to meet basic food, energy, and water5 needs. We demonstrate this approach by a multiobjective supply chain design of Li-battery which minimizes the ecological and social overshoot simultaneously. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fpubh.2023.1175605;As multiple crises deepen existing inequalities in urban societies within and between neighborhoods, strategically integrating nature-based solutions into the living environment can help reduce negative impacts and improve public health, social cohesion, and well-being. Compared to public green such as parks, semi-public residential greenery is rarely studied, is regularly overlooked by planners, and often receives step-motherly treatment from architects and housing companies. We approximated the area of residential greenery of modernist multi-story apartment complexes in Berlin, Germany. We surveyed residents’ suggestions for improving their living environments in vulnerable neighborhoods, report on co-creation experiences, and provide a practical guideline for optimizing health-promoting residential green spaces. The semi-public open space on the doorstep of two-thirds of Berlin’s population is highly fragmented and, in total, has a similar area as the public green spaces and a great potential for qualitative development. Just as the suitability of different nature-based solutions to be integrated into the residential greenery depends on building types, resident demands differ between neighborhoods. Residents called for more involvement in design, implementation, and maintenance, frequently proposing that biodiversity-friendly measures be included. As there is no universal solution even for neighborhoods sharing similar structural and socioeconomic parameters, we propose, and have tested, an optimization loop for health-promoting residential greening that involves exploring residents’ needs and co-creating local solutions for urban regeneration processes that can be initiated by different actors using bottom-up and/or top-down approaches in order to unlock this potential for healthy, livable and biodiversity friendly cities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.5846/STXB202204281179;"Goals of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality are the key strategic direction for construction of an ecological civilization. Based on the principle of “goals setting, system element layout, and solution strategies implementation”, this paper summarized the key points to achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality goals. As a cutting-edge concept, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) has been widely recognized by the international community. The core characteristics of sustainability, systematization, scale and adaptability of NbS can effectively promote the achievement of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality goals. As both taking sustainable development as the main goal, NbS is highly compatible with the goals of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality in goal orientation and thinking of practice. Furthermore the eight criteria of NbS can also provide a comprehensive and systematic framework for the active promotion of the goals of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality. Combined with the NbS criteria, eight issues are specifically proposed: (1) coordinating policy system for synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction; (2) strengthening the mechanism of information transmission in different scales; (3) building a nature-based pathway to carbon sequestration; (4) improving diversified carbon sink trading; (5) formulating participation rules that take into account social equity; (6) promoting path selection based on trade-offs; (7) innovating dynamic and long-term monitoring methods; and (8) promoting the mainstreaming of NbS in field of peak carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1201/9781003331001-11;Nature-based solutions (NbS) use nature to provide social, ecological, and economic advantages, which can aid in combating climate change and enhancing urban sustainability. However, their effectiveness is primarily dependent on execution, which is fraught with difficulties. We need a deeper knowledge of implementation being built in nature-based solutions frameworks for it to be significant in terms of producing good outcomes in cities. Biological, social, and economic issues are becoming more prevalent in cities, and as they do, they risk the endurance of metropolitan towns and the people who reside within. Such problems like persistent stressors and sudden shocks are made worse by changing climate. Ecosystem-based methods can be used in conjunction with nature-based solutions for societal issues. Nature-based solutions specifically aim to improve cities’ resilience. Establishing nature-based remedies is critical due to the variety of ecological systems, its flexibility, and the exchange among regulations as well as throughout chronological and regional dimensions. City planning may play a significant role in assisting the adoption of nature-based solutions, managing trade-offs and conflicts, and confirming that social justice elements are taken into account. This chapter proposes a paradigm for applying urban planning to the implementation of nature-based solutions, aiming at major trade-offs between temporal, geographical, functional, and societal dimensions. This emphasises the fundamental issues, also the supporting data needed to answer them, in order to justify the indulgence of nature-based remedies towards cities resilience. City planning may make a significant contribution, and there is still scope for understanding how naturally anthropocentric urban planning procedures can offer non-human nature a voice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/13549839.2023.2221431;Urban Climate Action Plans are instruments increasingly being used by governments to identify vulnerabilities and propose technological, engineered and ecosystem-based actions for adapting to and mitigating climate change effects. However, as the outcomes of the climate response could asymmetrically affect marginalised communities already more impacted by climate-related hazards, researchers and practitioners have expressed concerns regarding the lack of attention given to the environmental justice (EJ) implications of climate action planning. In this context, this study uses content analysis to review the inclusion and framing of EJ concerns in Urban Climate Action Plans from 30 Latin American cities as a less studied and particularly vulnerable world region. Moreover, we investigate whether and how these documents translate justice concerns into concrete strategies, with particular emphasis given to the use of Nature-based solutions. We found that, through the years, the concerns related to EJ are more prominent but are rarely concretised into specific actions. When they are, these actions are less framed within systemic policy interventions and more into educational and capacity-building strategies. Finally, most planning documents frame Nature-based solutions for biodiversity conservation purposes, forgoing the opportunity to adopt the socially transformative potential of the term for enhancing sustainable and just futures. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.17645/up.v8i1.6018;Since its introduction, the concept of “nature-based solutions” has gained much attention, drawing public funds and private investments. Nature-based solutions conceptualise the use of nature in planning as a cost-efficient and sustainable means to address societal, economic, and ecological challenges. However, this “triple win” premise tends to conceal potentially resulting injustices, such as displacement through green gentrification. While these injustices have attracted the attention of environmental justice scholars, as exemplified by the “just green enough” approach, links to the “nature-based solutions” concept are mostly implicit. Further, the concept of environmental privilege, questioning who benefits from created natural amenities, has rarely been taken up. This article, therefore, argues that environmental justice should be linked closely to nature-based solutions. Supported by a theoretical perspective, the article aims at exploring who benefits from, and who loses out on, urban nature-based solutions processes. It builds on a qualitative literature review of the scholarly landscape on environmental justice and urban greening while linking to nature-based solutions, adding perspectives of environmental privilege. In this, it attempts to offer three important contributions to the current academic discussion. First, the article provides an overview of the debate on urban greening, (in)justice, and environmental privilege. Second, it relates the concept of nature-based solutions to the debate on environmental justice, opening nature-based solutions up for critique and conceptual refinements. Third, it outlines a way forward for reframing nature-based solutions through the lens of environmental justice and privilege. Thus, this article provides a starting point for further discussions on the implementation of just nature-based solutions in cities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.17645/up.v8i1.6129;While global urban development is increasingly oriented towards strategies to facilitate green urbanism, potential community trade?offs are largely overlooked. This article presents the findings of a quantitative and qualitative meta?analysis of the current literature on green gentrification (the process leading the implementation of an environmental planning agenda displacing or excluding the most economically vulnerable population) in connection with climate change adaptation and mitigation across the globe. Based on specific keywords, we selected the recorded entry of 212 articles from Scopus covering the period 1977–2021. Our review focused on the historical and geographical development of the literature on urban greening and gentrification. The analysis shows that the concept of green gentrification has strong roots within the environmental justice debate in the US. In terms of intervention, most studies focused on urban parks and trees and were primarily oriented towards restoration. However, debates around the role of green facades, green roofs, or blue infrastructure (such as ponds and rivers) and other nature?based solutions as a driver for green gentrification are few and far between. Finally, we also identified a strong gap between the observation of green gentrification and potential countermeasures that respond to it. Most studies suggest that the existence of a stronger collaborative planning process within the affected communities may overcome the challenge of green gentrification. Based on our results, we identify several gaps and new research directions to design a green and just city. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s11027-022-10037-2;Climate change disproportionately impacts socially and economically marginalized populations. To rectify this imbalance, adaptation plans can explicitly include projects that not only lower the threat for these populations but also may provide co-benefits that improve the quality of their lives. One method to evaluate these co-benefits or any additional costs to these populations in the analysis of adaptation options is to monetize them. Monetization will convert these generally non-market impacts into monetary units and allow them to compared with each other as well as other market impacts in benefit–cost analyses. The monetized values can also be weighted by the utility of these benefits and costs to the different socio-economic groups in a population. Using illustrative case studies in two areas of Boston USA with different socio-economic conditions but similar population sizes and flood threats, this evaluation approach is tested when using nature-based solutions (NBS) to lower flood threats. The non-market benefits and costs included are improved air quality, availability of public transportation, recreational space, rent escalation due to gentrification, and prevented loss of wages due to reduction in mental stress. Utility is an inverse function of annual income. The case studies illustrate that by quantifying the non-market impacts the value of including adaptation actions that promote climate justice co-benefits can be shown. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/17565529.2022.2129954;Nature-based solutions (NbS), working with and enhancing nature to address societal challenges, are increasingly featured in climate change adaptation strategies. Despite growing evidence that NbS can reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts in general, understanding of the mechanisms through which this is achieved, particularly in the Global South, is lacking. To address this, we analyse 85 nature-based interventions across the rural Global South, and factors mediating their effectiveness, based on a systematic map of peer-reviewed studies encompassing a wide diversity of ecosystems, climate impacts, and intervention types. We apply an analytical framework of people's social-ecological vulnerability to climate change, in terms of six pathways of vulnerability reduction: social and ecological exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Most cases (95%) report a reduction in vulnerability, primarily by lowering ecosystem sensitivity to climate impacts (73% of interventions), followed by reducing social sensitivity (52%), reducing ecological exposure (36%), increasing social adaptive capacity (31%), increasing ecological adaptive capacity (19%), and/or reducing social exposure (14%). Our analysis shows that social dimensions of NbS are important mediating factors for equity and effectiveness. This study highlights how understanding the distinct social and ecological pathways by which vulnerability to climate change is reduced can help harness the multiple benefits of working with nature in a warming world. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.10.005;"The voices of young adults (15?24) ring faintly in the conversation around nature-based solutions (NBS), an absence that results in a lack of both procedural and distributive justice in the provision of such solutions. NBS clearly shape young adults — including their connections with nature, engagement in pro-environmental behaviours, and social and psychological health — but the dramatic reshaping of urban areas via rapid growth, densification, and technological innovation means today's young adults have fewer opportunities to benefit from NBS. In a potentially vicious cycle, this shortfall can result in a weakened sense of connection with nature, leading to less time spent in natural environments and fewer sustainable behaviours. Achieving justice for young adults requires understanding their preferences, clarifying relationships between NBS characteristics and use, and translating research into evidence-based design. This paper fills these gaps by summarising interdisciplinary knowledge regarding the impacts of contact with nature on the development and well-being of young adults; describing case studies conducted in formal parks located in Australia's largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne to clarify connections between our existing knowledge and the real-world provision of NBS; and applying these findings to develop an appraisal framework comprising three primary attributes — order, diversity, and seclusion and retreat — that supports the design and integration of urban greenspaces that uniquely benefit young adults’ social development and mental health. Finally, we explore the framework's implementation, demonstrating its utility and flexibility for urban planners, municipal policymakers, and natural-resource managers seeking to advance intergenerational equity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/s13280-022-01771-7;Heavily featured over the last few years in global research and policy agreements, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) remain however exposed to much debate over the ways their current design and ability to achieve both environmental goals and social needs. As they become mainstream climate mitigation and adaptation options, their capacity to deliver expected benefits, especially when contemplating equity and justice, is at least uncertain. Through a critical review of existing debates and perspectives on NBS, this paper questions their uptake and points at the frequent embeddedness of NBS in speculative and elite-based development paths in both urban and rural areas. We present an alternative, justice-oriented approach to NBS so that projects can avoid nature-enable dispossession and instead build nature-inspired justice that prioritizes the needs, identities, and livelihoods of the most ecologically and socially vulnerable residents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s13280-022-01772-6;Impact assessment is a key step in mainstreaming urban nature-based solutions (NBS). Yet, it remains unclear if and how assessment frameworks influence urban planning, design and management. We contend that the potential of current NBS assessment frameworks is not fully exploited due to: (1) limited contextualisation of monitoring and assessment to place-specific contexts and (2) the depoliticisation of co-production. To address this, we present a practical five-step action framework to guide inclusive participation across different stages of monitoring and assessment of urban NBS, including indicator selection. Unlike previous approaches, applying selection criteria at the level of individual indicators, we also use criteria at the aggregate level of the indicator set. We conclude that participatory assessment contributes to mainstreaming urban NBS for sustainable and just cities, provided data is contextualised to local decision-making contexts and the process is designed to amplify marginalised voices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.nbsj.2022.100027;The European Commission's (EC) double publication ‘Evaluating the impact of nature-based solutions’ (NBS) can be considered as a milestone for the adoption and evaluation of these solutions, which reportedly have a significant potential for climate change mitigation or the improvement of social justice. This optimistic view, however, is not equally held by everyone: a widespread scepticism over the NBS concept makes clear that the debate about the potential and convenience of NBS is far from over. Here we review some of this criticism and put this EC double document (handbook + appendix) under deep scrutiny, with the aim of proposing improvements for it and as an opportunity to discuss general aspects of the NBS field. In particular, we base our criticism on four perspectives: climate emergency, economy-driven ideology, ecolinguistics and the presence of logic pitfalls. The general aim of this article is to discuss the relevance of the NBS concepts present in the EC texts in relation to the climate crisis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2022.104051;Green infrastructure is a promising strategy aiming to address climate change impacts and associated flood risks, as well as bringing social equity benefits such as increased access to greenspace in urban areas. However, not only does it take up valuable development space, but the effectiveness of differing green infrastructure types in alleviating extreme rainfall impacts is unclear. This paper develops and tests scenarios linking various rainfall intensities (historical, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), types of green infrastructure (bio-retention cells, permeable pavement and rain gardens), and different spatial distributions (5 % and 10 % of the sub-catchment area) to investigate the extent to which green infrastructure can most effectively minimise flood risks while providing targeted equity benefits. Findings indicate that the implementation of 10 % of green infrastructure could reduce runoff peak rate and total runoff volume around 50–75 % at the sub-catchment scale. The paper provides two contributions. First, we develop and test a methodological approach that is able to link green infrastructure to climate and spatial futures. Second, we demonstrate which types of green infrastructure, and in which combinations, can most effectively reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Findings suggest that the strategic implementation of small green infrastructure areas can be hugely effective, particularly if multiple measures are combined. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.09.022;Scholarship on Nature-based Solutions (NbS) primarily focuses on the potential for NbS to deliver multiple benefits to humans and biodiversity from networked natural systems. These approaches, if enacted without sensitivity to local contexts and histories, can deepen long standing injustices resulting from the destruction of complex self-organizing ecological systems, the usurpation of Indigenous governance and knowledge, and the prioritization of technical managerial approaches transforming nature into infrastructure. Here we review, synthesize, and critically reflect on existing scholarship on the rise of NbS in New York City, USA, to inform environmental policy in support of just transformations of complex urban systems. To do so, we examine NbS within the context of the social-ecological-technological system (SETS) of NYC. We organize our review and synthesis around three interrelated concepts of justice: Ecological, Indigenous Environmental, and Infrastructural Justice. Ecological Justice entails addressing the harms, needs, and desired futures of ecological actors while identifying synergies with human focused environmental justice concerns and movements. Indigenous Environmental Justice requires restoring Indigenous systems of governance and knowledge while making space for a diversity of social-ecological practices of marginalized communities. Infrastructural Justice addresses the historical and ongoing injustices perpetuated through mainstream infrastructure policy and design practice – including Environmental Justice concerns – which have increasingly turned towards NbS. Without embedding these principles within emergent NbS focused environmental policy agendas seeking just transformations, they will likely recreate utilitarian, anthropocentric, and colonial modes of managing nature as infrastructure. We conclude with a research-to-action agenda for meeting the interdependent needs of urban ecosystems and humans. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s42532-022-00123-9;Dxwd?w refers to the Black-Green Rivers confluences that made the Duwamish River in Seattle, Washington, USA, prior to the 1910s. Significant industrial activity and human-made diversions to these rivers caused heavy pollution and eliminated 97% of historic wetlands, forever altering the historic river systems, salmon runs and human and aquatic health. Today the Green-Duwamish River and Duwamish Estuary are an industrial and commercial corridor, albeit also a site of cultural significance and fishing rights for urban Indigenous and Coast Salish tribes, and home and workplace to diverse urban populations of sustenance fishers, immigrants and refugees, communities of color, and low-income neighborhoods. Using a socio-ecological and environmental justice perspective within a nature-based solution, the Duwamish Floating Wetlands Project designed and piloted four constructed floating wetland structures for two years on the Duwamish River and researched their feasibility to provide habitat for out-migrating juvenile salmon. A multi-pronged community team (community leaders, liaisons, stewards and scientists) worked alongside academics and professionals. This paper showcases the formulation and adaptation of a two-year citizen/community science program integrated into the project. We outline the frameworks, approach, outcomes, and lessons-learned of the community science and outreach program, and compiled these in a list of guidelines to provide practitioner, researcher and community insight into the value and necessity of prioritizing environmental justice, racial equity, and ecosystem needs in nature-based solutions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.07.034;Environmental justice (EJ) addresses the unequal distribution of environmental goods and harms and promotes people's right to be involved in environmental decision-making. In recent years, EJ considerations have expanded to the use of Nature-based solutions (NbS) in urban areas, mainly how their planning and implementation can impact human well-being and social justice. However, what constitutes a just solution and how the concept is treated in the literature can take many forms. This study reviews how EJ is conceptualised and analysed in urban NbS research and documents the potential outcomes of diverse interventions. We developed a conceptual framework for the review process, focusing on the EJ definitions transferable to NbS research. We then conducted a systematic review of 152 articles published between 2000 and 2021. Selected articles addressed urban NbS from the recognitional, procedural and distributional interpretations of justice. Publication trends, methods, and demographic variables were recorded for each article. Furthermore, we focused on the means for assessing EJ in empirical terms, such as the framing of justice-related challenges, assessment indicators, and the reported justice outcomes. Findings demonstrate the dominance of research themes, the skewness towards the distributive dimension of justice, and a large variety of metrics and indicators used to assess EJ implications. Our results also show that EJ outcomes have mostly been reported to be mixed or negative. The results are used to identify research gaps and issues that need to be addressed to enhance EJ effects in urban NbS. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.09.013;"As researchers have continued to expand the bounds of green gentrification scholarship, understanding of what green gentrification is and how to identify the phenomenon on the ground has grown obscured. In an attempt to bring clarity to this conversation, our research presents an urban green gentrification framework, based on findings from a scoping review and dimensional analysis conducted across green gentrification, urban greening, and related literatures. Our study is guided by two primary objectives: (1) identify the key dimensions of green gentrification as it pertains to urban greening; and (2) explore the relationships and intersections between dimensions in terms of their implications for the social impacts and outcomes of urban greening initiatives. We identify three principle dimensions of green gentrification as it relates to urban greening — conceptual foundations; design and intent; and socio-spatial change — as well as six related sub-dimensions. Considered in tandem, these dimensions present green gentrification as a dynamic process bound within a history of exploitative, neoliberal social and economic processes, operating beyond the scope of any single urban greening initiative. Responding to green gentrification, therefore, requires trans-dimensional strategies that consider these structural influences guiding patterns of urban greening investment and development. Our results also show that green gentrification is not a sufficient explanation for the complexities of urban development and change, and greening should be considered alongside other drivers of gentrification more broadly. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102794;In the last two decades, there has been an exponential increase in application of public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods to urban green and blue space (UGBS) planning. However, integrating different elements of environmental justice in PPGIS research is still in its infancy, especially in regards to the deep and less visible issues related to recognition and participation of different groups in local green space planning and management. Here we present a new method for assessing perceived recognition and procedural justice with respect to UGBS in the Amager island of Copenhagen, Denmark. We collected survey data together with 2187 place-based values and preferences from 298 local residents. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis, we classified respondents in four clusters representing low to high perceived recognition and procedural justice. We then examined how these clusters relate to socio-demographics and the spatial distribution of mapped values and preferences. Results indicated no significant differences in terms of income and age between clusters. However, there was clear variation in the spatial distribution and type of values and preferences respondents from different clusters assigned, particularly for those who feel unrecognized and do not participate in local environmental decision-making compared to all other groups. In addition, gender had a significant effect on the perceptions of recognition and procedure. Female respondents scored lower on procedural justice than male and mapped landscape values and preferences closer to home than males, thus suggesting that gender inequalities can be deeply embedded in everyday public spaces and practices. Planning inclusive and environmentally just UGBS requires not only incorporating such gender perspectives, but a more flexible, intersectional and relational understanding of space that reflects the everyday needs of different and marginalized groups. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/frsc.2022.962168;"In recent decades, informal settlement upgrading and housing deficit in Latin America has been addressed through a variety of urban programs, usually structured around physical-spatial and social actions with an emphasis on the provision of basic infrastructure and services, improved accessibility and connectivity and new housing, mostly done by conventional means. In general, they fail to incorporate new frameworks that provide solutions with strong environmental roots, such as Nature-based Solutions (NbS), Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) or Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA). This article explores the potentiality of NbS/BGI in contributing to solve structural problems in marginal urban areas, the mindshifts and actor coalitions needed to support this and how it may promote equity and justice. This is analyzed in a particular setting: Villa 20, an informal settlement in the City of Buenos Aires that is undergoing a participatory urban upgrading process with a strong participatory platform made up of multiple spaces and devices for consensual decision-making on re-urbanization aspects. In Villa 20, several interrelated projects and programs are focusing on sustainability. In particular, the Transformative Urban Coalitions (TUC) of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) is connecting decarbonization with urban inequalities and urban justice. The article reflects on some of the initial outcomes of the TUC program that builds upon the ongoing participatory upgrading process. To discuss the links between the use of NbS, mindshifts and transformative urban coalitions we look into the social setting, methods and tools that promote mindset shift. We explore initial mindset changes in government teams; community leaders; and participants of an Urban Lab and the building up of a new transformative actor coalition. With this, we aim to better understand the possibilities and potential implications of implementing NbS in marginalized social contexts, contributing both to closing the knowledge gap and re-thinking future policies and programs. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.07.025;"There is increasing advocacy from academics, international agenda-setting organisations, and cities themselves for expert- and evidence driven approaches to multiple aspects of urban climate change and sustainability, including nature-based solutions. However, given growing interest in nature-based solutions research and practice towards questions of justice, it is important that the knowledge systems used to inform decisions about urban nature-based solutions are critically scrutinised. We use the lens of epistemic justice – justice in knowledge, with regard to how society defines a problem and the range of possible solutions – to assess nature-based solutions actions for climate adaptation and resilience across five cities: Amsterdam, Glasgow, Hanoi, Oslo, and Taipei. Our study finds common issues: the risk of quantifiable evidence about the distribution of NbS and its benefits closing down the aims of NbS strategies to meeting narrowly-defined indicators; the potential for self-defined communities of experts becoming de facto authorities on NbS; and the need for those tasked with implementing NbS ‘on the ground’ to have access to the fora and knowledge systems in which NbS strategies are developed. A key message is that more participation alone is insufficient to address epistemic justice concerns, unless it comes at a stage where a broad range of stakeholders (and their knowledges) can influence adaptation strategies and the role of NbS within them. Given the inter- and transdisciplinary nature of NbS scholarship, we argue attention must be focused on the potential for exclusion of key knowledge systems from policy and governance processes. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.5751/ES-13544-270405;"Traditional flood risk paradigms and associated strategies are no longer sufficient to address global flood adaptation challenges due to climate change and continued development in floodplains. The current flood adaptation approach is failing to take advantage of the benefits provided by intact ecosystems and perpetuates social and economic inequities, leaving those who are most vulnerable at highest risk. Rooted in the experiences of the United States, we propose a new framework, the Flood Adaptation Hierarchy, which prioritizes outcomes into six tiers. Overall, the tiers distinguish between nature and nature-based solutions, with preference given to natural ecosystems. The most important outcome in our hierarchy is to avoid risk by protecting and restoring natural floodplains; next, eliminate risk by moving communities away from danger; and then to accommodate water with passive measures and active risk reduction measures. We include, but deprioritize, a defense of community assets using nature-based engineering and hardened engineering. Throughout the hierarchy, we provide guidance on the equity considerations of flood adaptation decision making and highlight “impacts,” “resources,” and “voices” as important equity dimensions. Implementing the framework through an iterative process, using justification criteria to manage movement among tiers, alongside equity considerations, will support adaptation to changing environmental and social conditions and contribute to risk reduction at scale. Though this approach is focused on U.S. flood management and adaptation, prioritizing risk reduction, elimination of risk, and accommodation of hazards over the defense against threats not only has global applicability to flood adaptation, but should also be evaluated for applicability to other climate-driven challenges. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1088/1748-9326/ac9325;"Although cities globally are increasingly mobilizing re-naturing projects to address diverse urban socio-environmental and health challenges, there is mounting evidence that these interventions may also be linked to the phenomenon known as green gentrification. However, to date the empirical evidence on the relationship between greenspaces and gentrification regarding associations with different greenspace types remains scarce. This study focused on 28 mid-sized cities in North America and Western Europe. We assessed improved access to different types of greenspace (i.e. total area of parks, gardens, nature preserves, recreational areas or greenways [i] added before the 2000s or [ii] added before the 2010s) and gentrification processes (including [i] gentrification for the 2000s; [ii] gentrification for the 2010s; [iii] gentrification throughout the decades of the 2000s and 2010s) in each small geographical unit of each city. To estimate the associations, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model for each city and gentrification time period (i.e. a maximum of three models per city). More than half of our models showed that parks—together with other factors such as proximity to the city center—are positively associated with gentrification processes, particularly in the US context, except in historically Black disinvested postindustrial cities with lots of vacant land. We also find than in half of our models newly designated nature preserves are negatively associated with gentrification processes, particularly when considering gentrification throughout the 2000s and the 2010s and in the US. Meanwhile, for new gardens, recreational spaces and greenways, our research shows mixed results (some positive, some negative and some no effect associations). Considering the environmental and health benefits of urban re-naturing projects, cities should keep investing in improving park access while simultaneously implementing anti-displacement and inclusive green policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.001;Greening and green regeneration have been developed as a major strategy for improving quality of life in cities and neighbourhoods. Greening policies and projects are being applied at both the citywide and the neighbourhood level for various reasons, such as adaptation to climate change and the improvement of housing and living conditions as well as wellbeing and health. Urban policies, plans, and programmes have increasingly employed greening strategies to make urban neighbourhoods more attractive, to improve quality of life, and to provide residents with recreational space. At the same time, greening is increasingly “exploited” by market-oriented regeneration and construction strategies. The new critical debates on eco-gentrification—or distributional, procedural, and interactional injustices—are discussing emerging conflicts or trade-offs between green regeneration and the social or housing market impacts, as well as analysing the role of greening and green regeneration with respect to the (re)production of socio-spatial inequalities and injustices. Set against this background, our paper provides a comparative analysis of two cases—?ód? Stare Polesie (Poland) and Leipzig's inner east (Germany)—and has a threefold purpose: first, it seeks to analyse interconnections between greening policies and justice concerns. To operationalise the aforementioned interconnections, we will, second, develop an operational model that looks at interconnections as a process and applies a justice perspective that focuses on a multidimensional, intersectional, relational, and context- and policy-sensitive understanding of justice. Third, the paper seeks to detect how a contrasting comparison can help us to come to a better and more comprehensive understanding of the interconnections between green regeneration and justice. The study itself builds on primary research about the two cases from earlier projects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.06.018;Justice and fairness have become key considerations in sustainability pathways and nature-based solutions (NBS), following activists and critical scholars who have long argued that the urban environment is an inherently political space that requires an analysis of benefits and burdens associated with its existence, use, and access. However, what justice means and how it is expressed, recognized, or achieved is often implicit in the literature on NBS, even though underlying notions of justice shape the analysis done and actions proposed. This paper starts from the premise that justice knows many different interpretations, therefore warranting scholars and practitioners working on NBS to carefully consider the differences and frictions between competing meanings of justice. Drawing from the history of social and environmental justice theory, we give an account of some key justice dilemmas and discuss their tenets as it relates to the end, means, and participants in the making of justice. From this, we draw out questions and commitments academics and practitioners in the NBS space should grapple with more explicitly. We argue that the emergent tension between pragmatic policy approaches and critical theoretical engagement is hindering a version of NBS that goes beyond a reflection of the justice implications of NBS to ensuring that NBS contributes to the furthering of justice. We advocate for the inclusion of critical social sciences and humanities perspectives and approaches beyond tokenism to instead encourage ontological, epistemological, and political reflection of the work academics and practitioners do in the NBS space. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104506;Urban green infrastructure is central to integrated climate responses linking ecosystem services and social equity within urban planning for extreme heat in cities. This study examines the extent to which temperature regulating services from green infrastructure influence electricity consumption along with socio-economic gradient across urban neighbourhoods of Taipei Basin, Taiwan. Socio-ecological inequality was found to follow a complicated pattern, whereby green polarisation was revealed - both privileged and deprived neighbourhoods had greener and cooler environments. Yet, household salary was a more important factor for determining the increase of electricity consumption in summer than environmental attributes of greenspace proportion, distance to waters and temperature. Indigenous populations were socio-economically more disadvantaged, but they tended to receive greater cooling services from semi-natural areas and increased electricity usage less in summer. Neighbourhoods with a higher female proportion of population were less green, but socio-economically more privileged. In line with this spatial pattern, this study draws attention to the need to take various kinds of green infrastructure into account in a heat adaptation plan, and prioritise greening initiatives in areas which are subject to joint disparity in natural cooling services and economic capacity for house cooling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156687;The role of urban green space (UGS) in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect has been demonstrated in a growing body of literature. However, the potential influence of the spatial equity of UGS distribution on the UHI effect has largely been overlooked. The present study aims to identify this potential influence using the spatial equity of UGS and the land surface temperature (LST) as measures of UGS spatial distribution and UHIs, respectively. A comprehensive spatial distribution map of UGS was generated by combining the UGS coverage fraction data within urban impervious pixels and the green cover data outside urban impervious pixels. Then, the spatial equity of UGS distribution across all urban impervious pixels was determined using the Gini coefficient. In addition, an LST map was derived using the thermal infrared spectral bands of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS products. A case study of Dongguan, a highly urbanized city in China, showed that (1) the distribution of both UGS and LSTs were spatially aggregated in all the towns of the city, (2) the LST of urban impervious pixels was negatively correlated with the area of surrounding UGS, and (3) the Gini coefficient of UGS was positively correlated with the proportion of hot and cool areas, but negatively correlated with the proportion of medium-hot and medium-cool areas. These findings indicate that increasing the amount of UGS is beneficial to the reduction of urban average LSTs, while promoting the spatial equity of UGS distribution is conducive to reducing the spatial aggregation of LSTs within urban areas, thereby improving the overall urban thermal environment. Therefore, as a nature-based solution, promoting the spatial equity of UGS distribution could enhance the overall cooling effect of UGS more effectively at the city scale, and thus further underpin the sustainable development of the urban environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envsci.2022.06.020;Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been advocated for their potential to contribute to the making of sustainable and just cities. However, a growing body of research shows that NBS cannot inherently provide just outcomes and might instead (re)produce environmental injustices. This research explores NBS for stream/river restoration in ‘informal’ areas, showing how riparian margins have become spaces of conflict. It draws lessons from two linear parks integrated into neighbourhood regeneration strategies in São Paulo. Data were collected from household surveys and focus group discussions to examine local populations’ values towards stream restoration. They provide understandings of residents’ perceptions towards multiple health and safety risks and concerns over contested responsibilities, notably revealing that local preferences for stream burial have been shaped by persisting waste dumping issues. An environmental justice lens helps highlight the limited integration of plural social and cultural values into project plans. This further helps draw lessons on ways to address local conflicts and integrate multiple socio-environmental values into NBS planning, with support from policy tools that allow stronger community engagement. Findings also support the identification of justice pathways for NBS in informal settings. The analysis of material and interpretative human-environment relationships provides evidence of opportunities for NBS to be integrated into everyday uses of local space and pre-existing environmental caring practices. For this, communities need to have stronger influence over decisions affecting them. The research thereby demonstrates that NBS will only become a mechanism for ecological recovery with city-wide benefits if marginalised groups are better included in their planning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

10.3390/ijgi11090490;The mitigation of urban heat islands (UHIs) is crucial for promoting the sustainable development of urban areas. Geographic information systems (GISs) together with satellite-derived data are powerful tools for investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of UHIs. Depending on the availability of data and the geographic scale of the analysis, different methodologies can be adopted. Here, we show a complete open source GIS-based methodology based on satellite-driven data for investigating and mapping the impact of the UHI on the heat-related elderly risk (HERI) in the Functional Urban Area of Padua. Thermal anomalies in the territory were mapped by modelling satellite data from Sentinel-3. After a socio-demographic analysis, the HERI was mapped according to five levels of risk. The highest vulnerability levels were localised within the urban area and in three municipalities near Padua, which represent about 20% of the entire territory investigated. In these municipalities, a percentage of elderly people over 20%, a thermal anomaly over 2.4 °C, and a HERI over 0.65 were found. Based on these outputs, it is possible to define nature-based solutions for reducing the UHI phenomenon and promote a sustainable development of cities. Stakeholders can use the results of these investigations to define climate and environmental policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127682;To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2022.103792;Policy advocacy to address socioeconomic and racial/ethnic inequities in access to urban green space (e.g., parks) in the U.S. and elsewhere are often stymied by two dominant narratives on green space reinforced by politicians, business leaders, and mainstream media. The first argues that green space is “nice to have” but not necessary, and the second frames green space as “universally good” for economic development. In this paper, we study counter-narratives to push for equitable green space policy relying on qualitative research with 30 U.S. policy advocates about their experiences with green space equity work. We find that counter-narratives to the “nice to have” narrative could frame green space as essential, multifunctional, and resilient infrastructure. Also, counter-narratives to the “universally good” narrative could describe green space as a setting for equitable development, cultural representation and inclusiveness, and healing for people of color. Further, counter-narratives should be tailored to specific policy campaigns by targeting audiences, seizing historical opportunities (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), and centering the stories of disadvantaged people. These findings can be interpreted through the lens of structural racism and can provide pathways forward for advocates seeking to achieve green space equity through policy change and power building. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s13280-022-01723-1;Blue Carbon Ecosystems (BCEs) help mitigate and adapt to climate change but their integration into policy, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), remains underdeveloped. Most BCE conservation requires community engagement, hence community-scale projects must be nested within the implementation of NDCs without compromising livelihoods or social justice. Thirty-three experts, drawn from academia, project development and policy, each developed ten key questions for consideration on how to achieve this. These questions were distilled into ten themes, ranked in order of importance, giving three broad categories of people, policy & finance, and science & technology. Critical considerations for success include the need for genuine participation by communities, inclusive project governance, integration of local work into national policies and practices, sustaining livelihoods and income (for example through the voluntary carbon market and/or national Payment for Ecosystem Services and other types of financial compensation schemes) and simplification of carbon accounting and verification methodologies to lower barriers to entry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su14169887;This paper aims to expand the current debate concerning the implementation of health-related innovations by employing the rights-based approach. Specifically, we address the challenges related to the implementation of technological and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) from the right to the city perspective. As a result, we present a comprehensive Civil City Framework that involves the synergic use of ICT tools and participation models to mobilize grassroots potential for building healthier cities, while ensuring equity and respect for diverse needs. We explain the participatory and technological aspects of implementing and monitoring innovative NBS, involving data gathering through environmental sensors, personal wristbands, and smartphone apps. Finally, we highlight opportunities and challenges stemming from the use of health- and environment-monitoring technologies. To build such a vision one needs to reconceive the city as commons, enabling collective action of city residents and cooperation between different local stakeholders. This can be achieved by embedding a pentahelix approach of multi-governance in urban planning, based on a close interaction between five key stakeholders, including public authorities, industry and business sector, academia, civil society organizations, and individual citizens. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.hydroa.2022.100127;A robust multi-functional framework for widespread planning of nature-based solutions (NBS) must incorporate components of social equity and hydro-environmental performance in a cost-effective manner. NBS systems address stormwater mitigation by increasing on-site infiltration and evaporation through enhanced greenspace while also improving various components of societal well-being, such as physical health (e.g., heart disease, diabetes), mental health (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression), and social cohesion. However, current optimization tools for NBS systems rely on stormwater quantity abatement and, to a lesser extent, economic costs and environmental pollutant mitigation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore how NBS planning may be improved to maximize hydrological, environmental, and social co-benefits in an unequivocal and equitable manner. Here, a novel equity-based indexing framework is proposed to better understand how we might optimize social and physical functionalities of NBS systems as a function of transdisciplinary characteristics. Specifically, this study explores the spatial tradeoffs associated with NBS allocation by first optimizing a local watershed-scale model according to traditional metrics of stormwater efficacy (e.g., cost efficiency, hydrological runoff reduction, and pollutant load reduction) using SWMM modeling. The statistical dispersion of social health is then identified using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which is a high-resolution spatial account of socioeconomic disadvantages that have been linked to adverse health outcomes, according to United States census properties. As NBSs have been shown to mitigate various adverse health conditions through increased urban greening, this improved understanding of geospatial health characteristics may be leveraged to inform an explicit representation of social wellness within NBS planning frameworks. This study presents and demonstrates a novel framework for integrating hydro-environmental modeling, economic efficiency, and social health deprivation using a dimensionless Gini coefficient, which is intended to spur the positive connection of social and physical influences within robust NBS planning. Hydro-environmental risk (according to hydro-dynamic modeling) and social disparity (according to ADI distribution) are combined within a common measurement unit to capture variation across spatial domains and to optimize fair distribution across the study area. A comparison between traditional SWMM-based optimization and the proposed Gini-based framework reveals how the spatial allocation of NBSs within the watershed may be structured to address significantly more areas of social health deprivation while achieving similar hydro-environmental performance and cost-efficiency. The results of a case study for NBS planning in the White Oak Bayou watershed in Houston, Texas, USA revealed runoff volume reductions of 3.45% and 3.38%, pollutant load reductions of 11.15% and 11.28%, and ADI mitigation metrics of 16.84% and 35.32% for the SWMM-based and the Gini-based approaches, respectively, according to similar cost expenditures. As such, the proposed framework enables an analytical approach for balancing the spatial tradeoffs of overlapping human-water goals in NBS planning while maintaining hydro-environmental robustness and economic efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/atmos13071027;Nature-based solutions (NbS) present an opportunity to reduce rising temperatures and the urban heat island effect. A multi-scale study in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, evaluates the effect of NbS on air and land surface temperature through two field campaigns at the micro and meso scales, using in situ measurements and LANDSAT imagery. This research demonstrates that the application of NbS in the form of green infrastructure has a beneficial impact on urban climate regimes with measurable reductions in air and land surface temperatures. Broad implementation of green infrastructure is a sustainable solution to improve the urban climate, enhance heat and greenspace equity, and increase resilience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1002/eet.1987;The last half-a-century has seen a marked demand for authentic citizen participation in public policy-and decision-making, not least in the field of sustainability. The depth and forms of citizen engagement in nature-based solutions (NBS), for example, and how such participation shapes their trajectories is gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we analyze current forms and implications of citizen participation in 58 NBS case studies conducted in 21 cities in the light of supporting wider sustainability goals. Our results show that while tokenistic forms dominate citizen participation across a variety of NBS contexts, collaborative multi-stakeholder forms of engagement do not automatically lead to enhanced ecological functions. Deeper forms of engagement, however, strengthen and diversify both expected and unexpected social outcomes, including social learning, enhanced sense of belonging, environmental stewardship, and inclusiveness and equity, in general. Driven by neoliberal austerity logic governments often cede power to NBS promoters whose interests predefine an intervention's vision of nature. Deeper levels of participation are hence limited by inherent institutional structures, neoliberal regimes and the lack of trust among actors involved. These limitations can be partially bridged by strengthening relational and reflexive capacities of public institutions. Focusing on the process of citizen engagement and creating multiple arenas for discussion could bring out new voices and narratives and also transform the culture of participation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.envres.2022.112869;A growing literature shows that green space can have protective effects on human health. As a marginalized group, women often have worse life outcomes than men, including disparities in some health outcomes. Given their marginalization, women might have “more to gain” than men from living near green spaces. Yet, limited research has deliberately studied whether green space-health associations are stronger for women or men. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize empirical evidence on whether sex or gender modifies the protective associations between green space and seven physical health outcomes (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, general physical health, non-malignant respiratory disease, mortality, and obesity-related health outcomes). After searching five databases, we identified 62 articles (including 81 relevant analyses) examining whether such effect modification existed. We classified analyses based on whether green space-health were stronger for women, no sex/gender differences were detected, or such associations were stronger for men. Most analyses found that green space-physical health associations were stronger for women than for men when considering study results across all selected health outcomes. Also, women showed stronger protective associations with green space than men for obesity-related outcomes and mortality. Additionally, the protective green space-health associations were slightly stronger among women for green land cover (greenness, NDVI) than for public green space (parks), and women were also favored over men when green space was measured very close to one's home (0–500 m). Further, the green space-health associations were stronger for women than for men in Europe and North America, but not in other continents. As many government agencies and nongovernmental organizations worldwide work to advance gender equity, our review shows that green space could help reduce some gender-based health disparities. More robust empirical studies (e.g., experimental) are needed to contribute to this body of evidence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s13280-021-01685-w;Nature-based solutions (NBS) were introduced as integrated, multifunctional and multi-beneficial solutions to a wide array of socio-ecological challenges. Although principles for a common understanding and implementation of NBS were already developed on a landscape scale, specific principles are needed with regard to an application in urban areas. Urban areas come with particular challenges including (i) spatial conflicts with urban system nestedness, (ii) specific urban biodiversity, fragmentation and altered environments, (iii) value plurality, multi-actor interdependencies and environmental injustices, (iv) path-dependencies with cultural and planning legacies and (v) a potential misconception of cities as being artificial landscapes disconnected from nature. Given these challenges, in this perspective paper, we build upon and integrate knowledge from the most recent academic work on NBS in urban areas and introduce five distinct, integrated principles for urban NBS design, planning and implementation. Our five principles should help to transcend governance gaps and advance the scientific discourse of urban NBS towards a more effective and sustainable urban development. To contribute to resilient urban futures, the design, planning, policy and governance of NBS should (1) consider the need for a systemic understanding, (2) contribute to benefiting people and biodiversity, (3) contribute to inclusive solutions for the long-term, (4) consider context conditions and (5) foster communication and learning. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land11040579;"Much has been debated regarding the environmental and economic aspects that conform the pillars of sustainability in nature-based solutions (NbSs). However, the social implications are lagging behind in both theory and practice. NbSs are not inherently socially and environmentally just and they might not work for or benefit everyone. On the contrary, they may lead to unequal environmental tradeoffs influencing therefore community acceptance. This research explored the different levels of community acceptance of NbSs in the Tordera delta (Catalonia) through struc-tured interviews and Q-methodology with representative stakeholders. It pretended to contribute to more just NbS discussions by identifying variables of community acceptance through a socio-environmental perspective. The results exposed existing socio-economic and socio-spatial differences that cause unequal co-benefits and tradeoffs among stakeholders of the area. Three distinctive discourses were identified: (1) NbSs as an opportunity to re-naturalize the river; (2) the possibility of NbS implementation if aligned with the current socio-economic structure of the delta; and (3) the belief in a hybrid NbS future, combining grey infrastructure and NbSs. Building on those results and discussions, the paper reflected on a restructuration of the delta’s governance through further collaborative processes to seek a more socio-environmentally just and inclusive NbSs in the area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.cosust.2022.101168;Smart city development is expanding rapidly globally and is often argued to improve urban sustainability. However, these smart developments are often technology-centred approaches that can miss critical interactions between social and ecological components of urban systems, limiting their real impact. We draw on the social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) literature and framing to expand and improve the impact of smart city agendas. A more holistic systems framing can ensure that ‘smart’ solutions better address sustainability broadly and extend to issues of equity, power, agency, nature-based solutions and ecological resilience. In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems. We provide a series of examples of subsystems interactions, or ‘couplings’, to illustrate how a SETS approach can expand and enhance smart city infrastructure and development to meet normative societal goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1017/sus.2022.4;"Non-technical summary Many conservation initiatives call for 'transformative change' to counter biodiversity loss, climate change, and injustice. The term connotes fundamental, broad, and durable changes to human relationships with nature. However, if oversimplified or overcomplicated, or not focused enough on power and the political action necessary for change, associated initiatives can perpetuate or exacerbate existing crises. This article aims to help practitioners deliberately catalyze and steer transformation processes. It provides a theoretically and practically grounded definition of 'transformative conservation', along with six strategic, interlocking recommendations. These cover systems pedagogy, political mobilization, inner transformation, as well as planning, action, and continual adjustment. Technical summary Calls for 'transformative change' point to the fundamental reorganization necessary for global conservation initiatives to stem ecological catastrophe. However, the concept risks being oversimplified or overcomplicated, and focusing too little on power and the political action necessary for change. Accordingly, its intersection with contemporary biodiversity and climate change mitigation initiatives needs explicit deliberation and clarification. This article advances the praxis of 'transformative conservation' as both (1) a desired process that rethinks the relationships between individuals, society, and nature, and restructures systems accordingly, and (2) a desired outcome that conserves biodiversity while justly transitioning to net zero emission economies and securing the sustainable and regenerative use of natural resources. It first reviews criticisms of area-based conservation targets, natural climate solutions, and nature-based solutions that are framed as transformative, including issues of ecological integrity, livelihoods, gender, equity, growth, power, participation, knowledge, and governance. It then substantiates six strategic recommendations designed to help practitioners deliberately steer transformation processes. These include taking a systems approach; partnering with political movements to achieve equitable and just transformation; linking societal with personal ('inner') transformation; updating how we plan; facilitating shifts from diagnosis and planning to action; and improving our ability to adjust to transformation as it occurs.

10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108714;Ecological Security Patterns (ESPs) are important nature-based solutions for ecological problems caused by urbanization and industrialization. Previous studies on ESPs focus on natural conditions only, yet do not incorporate the need for social equity. This study aims to address this quandary for the study area of Wuhan by identifying and extracting ecological sources and ecological corridors, followed by an ecological sensitivity assessment, minimum cumulative resistance model and buffer analysis, in order to construct and optimize ecological security patterns. The optimization for the construction of the most suitable ecological security patterns relies on social equity aspects, including the quality of urban ecological services and the improvement of the well-being of urban residents. The results demonstrate: (1) There are 19 ecological sources in Wuhan and 51 ecological corridors with a total length of 840.10 km. (2) To cater for the optimization of social equity needs, it was necessary to add one additional amendment source, with an area of 14.89 km2, and 25 new amendment corridors with a total length of 287.8 km. (3) Optimizing the ecological security patterns in Wuhan is possible through the derivation of an ecological restoration area, ecological improvement area, ecological control area and ecological shield area. The results indicate the feasibility of simultaneously protecting urban ecological security and realizing social equity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-030-89525-9_4;"This chapter presents a framework for the identification of challenges, and the planning and implementation of nature-based solutions taking into account the complexities of cities in the developing world, in particular Brazil. It focuses on the interactions between environmental, socio-cultural and technological aspects of the context, both in terms of its challenges and pathways for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). In its first part, the chapter presents the definition of the framework. The second part applies it to the case of the Federal District in Brazil. The chapter shows that (1) these aspects are strongly interlinked, supporting the need for the development and application of systemic and integrative planning frameworks; (2) the values of urban nature are contextually driven, hence local knowledge must be employed in order to maximise the benefits of ecosystem services (ES) implementation and minimise potential perceived and tangible disservices; (3) social equity need to frame the spatial distribution of ES arising from NBS and include environmental resilience; (4) revisiting both formal and informal urban morphology patterns can further potentialise the mainstreaming of NBS; (5) the application of NBS developed for formal urban spaces can fall short of applicability in informal contexts, yet informality can be a source of innovation for NBS if considered from within; and finally, (6) that expanding the use of digital technologies and tools for data acquisition, processing, and modeling can enhance local governments’ ability to build better scenarios and improve evidence-based planning. The results can help urban areas in similar contexts face the challenges of implementing NBS in city and regional planning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
x;Landscape architecture has been one of the great contributions of the Modern Movement, both in spatial and aesthetic terms and in terms of its social commitment, which substantially improved the quality of urban life. Today, much of this heritage is affected by the passage of time or requires adaptation to profound contextual changes. In addition, the global health crisis provoked by COVID 19 exposed conflicts - overdensity, social inequality, lack of community spaces - that reposition public space as one of the priority issues on the urban agenda. In this context, schools of architecture find in the re-use of modern public space an opportunity to integrate in their didactic strategies essential themes of our time: the social, cultural and environmental dimension. However, academic programmes are more focused on the artistic and technical education of the architect and have some resistance to integrate these themes. Instead, concepts and tools such as social participation, gender perspective, intersectional and intercultural approaches, collective memory, nature-based solutions, among others, allow transcending the production of abstract objects to design human and healthy spaces with a true sense of inclusion, equity, diversity and innovation. In this sense, this paper proposes a common pedagogical programme that addresses the potential of integrating the open space produced according to Modern Movement principles into an inclusive public space that takes in consideration the contemporary urban challenges. Combining perspectives and knowledge from the north and south, this educational network is based on didactic and research projects developed in Europe (Coimbra, Portugal) and South America (Buenos Aires, Argentina and Campinas, Brazil). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-031-07301-4_6;As cities around the world are increasingly facing the impacts of climate change, a growing number of municipalities are leading collaborative projects to adapt schools to rising temperatures. The implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) is highlighted as an important component to be included in these initiatives given their multifunctional and cost-effective character. However, the challenges and upscaling opportunities of these pioneering projects are still not well understood nor systematically studied on a comparative basis. This study explores and compares three European pilot nature-based projects aiming to make schools more resilient to climate change impacts while creating other co-benefits for children and the wider local community. These projects are Oasis (Paris), Climate Shelters (Barcelona) and Care in School Environments (Madrid). Building on a framework for assessing the co-benefits of urban NBS, the comparative analysis explores the selection criteria of schools and their equity implications, the multifunctional role of NBS beyond climate adaptation, the main aspects and challenges related to the co-design process and the subsequent project implementation and the potential for upscaling at the city level. Based on this exploration, we contend that nature-based climate adaptation projects in schools can be a spearhead for a wider community-based strategy towards urban resilience. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

10.5751/ES-13303-270320;Green roofs provide multiple benefits including reducing the urban heat island effect, absorbing stormwater and air pollution, and serving as habitat for wildlife. However, many cities have not taken advantage of green roofs as a nature-based solution. In New York City (NYC), approximately 20% of the landscape is covered by buildings, thus rooftops present a substantial opportunity for expanding green infrastructure. Spatial data on green roofs are critical for understanding their abundance and distribution, what filters may drive spatial patterns, and who benefits from them. We describe the development of a green roof dataset for NYC based on publicly available data and classification of aerial imagery from 2016. Of the over one million buildings in NYC, we found only 736 with green roofs (<0.1%), although there may have been others we did not detect. These green roofs are not evenly distributed in NYC-they are most common in midtown and downtown Manhattan, while most other areas have few to none. Green roofs tend to be more prevalent in parts of NYC with combined sewer systems, but some such areas, and those with the most heat-vulnerable communities, have few if any despite their potential to help ameliorate stormwater and urban heat challenges. Though green roofs are providing some benefits within NYC, we anticipate they are filtered based on dynamics of infrastructure, institutions, and perceptions, rather than targeted to address climate and weather-related challenges. There is substantial opportunity in NYC to increase green roofs, and equity of them. The dataset we developed is publicly available and can serve as a baseline for tracking these assets through time, while supporting further research, conversations, and policies related to the benefits and distribution of green roofs. The underlying methods can also be applied to help fill similar data gaps in other cities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-981-19-2662-4_6;With more countries and companies setting net-zero targets, nature-based solutions (NBS) provides a great opportunity for carbon sequestration through forest and wetland preservation, recovery, and reforestation programs. The benefits also extend to preserving biodiversity and providing social co-benefits and equity in communities. This chapter considers the potential of natural assets convertible to carbon credits in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, which is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Recent developments in establishing a carbon offset market exchange have been based on regional NBS. There will be significant need for FinTech such as financial instruments and associated technological innovations to develop large-scale regional carbon credit markets or voluntary carbon markets. In this chapter, Singapore’s Climate Impact X (CIX) is examined as a case study. Marketplaces and exchanges allow producers and consumers to interact on sustainability metrics and impacts, facilitating sales of carbon credits, biodiversity offsets, and ethically sourced and labelled products. FinTech solutions emerging in the areas of digital exchanges for carbon credits (biodiversity in the future) and e-trading of natural capital-backed digital assets include technologies such as satellite imagery, Internet-of-things data, application program interfaces, data tokens, blockchain for climate impact reporting, and more. Currently, there is a huge opportunity to reduce emissions and conserve existing forestland and wetlands through NBS. However, there remain barriers to making full use of FinTech solutions for NBS and scaling a carbon market in ASEAN such as costs of technology, logistics, MRV (measurement, reporting, and verification), and lack of regulation and regional coordination. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/698_2021_759;Nature-based solutions (NbS) are often framed positively in terms of win–win options or no-regret measures. However, are NbS equally beneficial for everyone? Are burdens and benefits of NbS really equally distributed and projects embraced by everyone? Is the process leading to the implementation of NbS always fair and inclusive? This chapter provides a broad overview of different environmental justice issues, critically reflecting on NbS through recognition justice, procedural justice, and distributive justice. Whereas the current critical literature focuses particularly on urban NbS, this chapter focuses on the wider translocal consequences of NbS projects. The theoretical reflections are illustrated with case studies of NbS from various countries: the recognition of marginalised women in Vietnam in mangrove restoration projects, the challenges when introducing procedural justice in implementing NbS in Serbia, the legal injustices locals are faced in the Czech Republic when they want to implement NbS, the trade-off between public collective and individual economic interest when implementing a sand nourishment project in the Netherlands, and the development of a beneficiary-pays based upstream–downstream compensation scheme in Austria. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101079;"Public policy in the US is partially influenced by public opinion. Studies that focus on the factors that predict urban populations' strong supports for local climate adaptation policies are still lacking. Engaging environmental and public policy behavior and recognition justice approaches, we argue people's support for urban climate policies reveal certain vulnerable communities' lack of recognition in local adaptation decision-making processes. Using the 2011 Phoenix Area Social Survey, we focus on two climate adaptation policies: 1) increasing the number of trees planted along public streets, a nature-based solution; 2) engineering new paving materials that absorb less heat”, a technology-oriented infrastructure configuration to deal with rising temperatures in the Phoenix Metro Area, Arizona. We found climate change beliefs and acknowledging climate change as a threat to people's households and ways of life are the strongest predictors supporting the two suggested local climate policies. While individuals other than non-Hispanic White background and who identify themselves as liberal strongly support a nature-based solution, people who are 41 to 56 years of age support a technology-oriented infrastructure configuration. Further studies must focus on the persistent power asymmetries and divergence in regulations spurred from the state and local governments that inhibit further climate actions through urban planning and design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1007/978-3-030-86304-3_14;A growing body of evidence across distinct disciplines points out the tremendous role of environment quality in shaping the health and well-being of urban populations. While some elements and characteristics of the environment can contribute to health problems, others can be used as tools to promote health throughout the lifespan, facilitate recovery, and develop resilience against health risks present in constantly expanding cities. Concurrently, healthcare systems are economically and logistically burdened, emphasizing the need for cost-effective and universally accessible self-care solutions to support traditional treatments, as well as policy tools to bring self-care solutions to people. In this chapter we discuss the impact of urbanization on mental and physical health, as well as broad community health, and provide directions for researchers and policy makers for nature-based solutions aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. Insights from urban planning and design, clinical and epidemiological research, social science, and environmental justice have informed our proposal for a novel framework—Harmonious Ecosystem for Sustainable Solutions in Urban Health, based on the 4Rs frame of action: Recognize, Research, provide Resources and Rebuild.

10.1007/s13280-021-01553-7;Planning for and implementing multifunctional nature-based solutions can improve urban ecosystems’ adaptation to climate change, foster urban resilience, and enable social and environmental innovation. There is, however, a knowledge gap in how to design and plan nature-based solutions in a nonanthropocentric manner that enhances co-benefits for humans and nonhuman living organisms. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how an ecological justice perspective can advance the understanding of nature-based solutions. We argue that ecological justice, which builds on the equitable distribution of environmental goods and bads, social–ecological interconnectedness, nature’s agency and capabilities, and participation and inclusion in decision-making, provides a transformative framework for rethinking nature-based solutions in and for cities. A qualitative analysis of 121 peer-reviewed records shows a highly human-centred worldview for delivering nature-based solutions and a relationship to social justice with no direct reference to the dimensions of ecological justice. There is, however, an underlying recognition of the importance of nonhumans, ecosystem integrity and well-being, and a need to consider their needs and capacities through multispecies nature-based solutions design and planning. We conclude with a discussion of the critical aspects for designing and planning ecologically just cities through nature-based solutions and future research directions to further integrate these fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

Nature-based Solutions harness nature’s benefits to address these environmental, social, and economic challenges. In this study, we investigate how taking into account temporal dynamics and multiple values of nature helps to implement better Nature-based Solutions. Through satellite images and interviews with practitioners and residents, we look at how green spaces and dry riverbeds are distributed, managed, and perceived in the capital city of Namibia, south-western Africa. We find that apartheid spatial segregation legacies persist through the unequal distribution of urban green spaces, and that, although their current management limits their capacity to deliver benefits, riverbeds have the potential to support sustainable development and climate change adaptation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.oneear.2021.11.010;"Cities are home to around half of the global population but face intensified and unevenly distributed heat stresses. Trees are utilized to adapt to urban heat; however, most tree planting is prioritized by either biophysical or social metrics, rather than an integration of the two. It therefore remains unclear how to maximize ecological and social benefits of tree planting in the context of environmental justice. Here, we analyze social vulnerability to heat and the cooling capacity of trees across 38 of the largest cities in the United States. We find that socially vulnerable people tend to live in hotter neighborhoods with less tree canopy. Furthermore, tree planting in such neighborhoods can achieve greater cooling benefits per unit increase in canopy. Increasing tree cover in these neighborhoods will meet the greatest need for cooling and achieve greater cooling capacity, creating social and ecological co-benefits. Adaptation measures must address both the distributional injustices of urban heat and procedural justice in planning and managing nature-based cooling approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.nbsj.2021.100007;Nature-based solutions have emerged as a concept for integrating ecosystem-based approaches whilst addressing multiple sustainable development goals. However, implementing nature-based solutions is inherently complex and requires consideration of a range of environmental and socio-economic conditions that may impact on their effectiveness. This research assesses ecosystem services within the Valletta urban agglomeration, Malta, and evaluates the implications arising from existing distributional patterns. Proxy-based indicators and expert knowledge were used to map and assess a set of 14 ecosystem services. Proximity and correlation analyses were used to assess distributional inequalities arising from differentiated availability of ecosystem types with high ecosystem service capacities for groups with different socio-economic characteristics. Data relating to schooling, employment, sickness, disability, and old age, were combined to identify areas of relative advantage and disadvantage. The highest ecosystem service capacities were in the urban fringes and the lowest in dense urban cores. Private gardens and urban trees had the highest regulating ecosystem service capacities per unit area. Contrastingly, public gardens had low effectiveness for regulating ecosystem services but the highest cultural ecosystem service capacities. Availability of urban green infrastructure and tree cover differ according to socio-economic advantage, and disadvantaged communities generally had reduced proximity to ecosystems with high ecosystem service capacities. Considering these findings, we argue that urban ecosystem service assessments can support greening strategies by identifying the most effective nature-based solutions that can play a redistributive role by addressing existing inequalities in green infrastructure and ecosystem services capacities distribution in cities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.5379/urbani-izziv-en-2021-32-supplement-1;Providing the largest number of persons the possibility to actively move and contribute to their own well-being also depends on the spatial accessibility to urban environment. From this perspective, the present article addresses two main questions: To what extent can the physical arrangement of public spaces play a key role in enabling individuals' capabilities to lead a healthy life, and how can accessibility affect urban regeneration. Accessibility is here understood as a fundamental right of citizenship and as a prompt to set the reflection on sensorial/cognitive/motor disabilities within a broader frame, covering many fields of urban agendas: Social justice and health, sustainable mobility and Universal Design, and nature-based solutions. COVID-19 distancing measures have further emphasized the importance of these issues, stressing the need to make urban spaces walkable and usable for the most vulnerable citizens. The research Proactive City, developed at the University of Trieste (IT), offers input into this debate. The outcomes of design workshops in the Italian region Friuli Venezia Giulia, as well as of collaboration activities with the Regional Administration, provide technical and methodological recommendations to rethink accessibility for all, not as synonymous with special solutions addressed to persons with disabilities but as an overall approach to envisaging any urban transformation and policy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

We draw from environmental justice scholarship, as well as climate and water justice literature to assess the state-of-the-art knowledge of urban GI justice. We examine the way GI is researched to improve our understanding of the types of injustices that exist in GI planning, siting, and implementation, providing rich insights into why injustices exist and pathways to address GI injustice. We find that research on GI justice in cities is growing and expanding its scope in terms of both the types of justice issues analyzed, and the groups of people excluded from the benefits of GI. We find that GI injustice stems from a history of unequal investment and non-participatory decision-making processes, where the unequal distribution of GI is only the “tip of the iceberg”. To address GI injustice around distribution, cities would have to offset a decades-long lack of investment and inclusivity in decision-making processes. Pathways to achieve GI justice point to assessing unbalanced power structures, directing continuous funding to community engagement programs and greening efforts, leveraging existing infrastructure through the multifunctionality of GI, and dedicating funding mechanisms for safety and maintenance. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research is needed to integrate the different dimensions of GI that are tailored to the community on the ground, and to monitor progress toward justice. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1177/2514848620962420;"‘Nature-Based Integration’ (NBI) has been proposed as a solution to two prominent issues in contemporary Nordic societies: increasing separation from nature among ‘modern’ societies; and the need to ‘integrate’ groups of diverse newcomers. This article examines NBI activities in Örebro County, central Sweden, exploring how these practices seek to bring immigrants into a shared Swedish experiential landscape that forms part of the work of ordering Sweden as a community. These activities form part of an ordering project, within which ‘Swedes’ and ‘newcomers’ are situated, drawing on extant nationalist orderings. Likewise, it represents part of an effort to enact a sustainable Sweden in an international world. Drawing on research on environmental racism and (in)justice, this article homes in on the norms implicit and explicit to this ordering. It then discusses the implications of this, highlighting (arguably unavoidable) coercive elements. Furthermore, the long history of outdoor lifestyle as a pillar of Swedish nationalism and the embracing of such activities by the Swedish far right highlight that nature may also become a site of conflict as much as conciliation. Finally, the article considers the types of environmental action arising from the NBI orderings and the likelihood of meaningful environmental change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1891/cn-2021-0015;"Background: Climate change is one of the most significant threats to public health we currently face. While the link between climate change and health is clear, many nurses have not received education on climate change, as it may not routinely be included in nursing curricula. This lack of knowledge can prevent nurses from engaging in climate solutions, incorporating climate change into their practice or research, or participating in climate advocacy within their institutions or with policymakers. Methods: Nurses Drawdown is a web-based platform that builds on the work of Project Drawdown, which identifies and quantifies effective, evidence-based climate solutions. Nurses Drawdown utilizes evidence-based techniques for web design and movement building to engage a global nursing audience on five areas of action that have clear links to health: Energy, Food, Gender Equity, Mobility, and Nature-Based Solutions. Results: Sixteen nursing organizations signed on with Nurses Drawdown as official partners; within 1 month of going live, nurses from 16 countries had committed to take action. Web-based movement building can effectively engage a global nursing audience. However, new partnerships with nursing organizations may not form until there is proof of nursing engagement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1002/ieam.4453;"The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) manages hundreds of reservoirs and thousands of miles of navigation channels that provide invaluable flood control, commercial transport of materials, water supply, recreation, and stream flow regulation. This capability is being threatened by the continued occurrence of large-scale wildfires across the western United States. The wildfires damage watersheds in part by denuding landscapes, reducing infiltration rates, and increasing runoff rates, thereby dramatically increasing the potential for the erosion of denuded slopes, destabilizing stream channels, increasing the infilling potential of reservoirs and, hence, reducing their capacity. The increased erosion rates highlight the need to develop innovative solutions to reduce erosion of watersheds laid bare after wildfires engulf the area. The Santa Clara Pueblo in northern New Mexico extends from the top of the eastern Jemez Mountains to the floodplains of the Rio Grande River. The Pueblo designed and constructed thousands of structures built from natural materials, consistent with Engineering With Nature (EWN) principles for erosion control incorporating low-cost and readily available materials such as logs, mulch, vegetation, and local rock to stabilize highly erodible parts of the watershed. The watersheds where these natural structures were constructed were monitored after construction to assess their effectiveness, guiding a series of recommendations for broader implementation. As part of a continued emphasis on updating USACE engineering guidance, research, and development, funding has been focused on developing sustainable and resilient project designs using natural materials like those implemented by the Santa Clara Pueblo. This paper focuses on the innovative EWN-based watershed stabilization practices that were implemented in the upper section of this wildfire affected canyon and tributary streams. Recommendations for future implementation based on lessons learned from this project are also provided. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;17:1194–1202. Published 2021.

10.3389/fclim.2021.724065;Building on the considerable momentum from the commencement of the Decade of Ocean Science, the Ocean-climate nexus will be center stage at COP26. Many countries are including blue carbon Ocean commitments in their second round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and there is a need to harmonize the science, law, and economics of Ocean-based climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to enable implementation of Ocean commitments under the Paris Agreement. In addition, consistent with the Paris Agreement preamble's focus on human rights, the rights and empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized communities, and intergenerational equity, the design and implementation of Ocean commitments in NDCs should be centered on considerations of climate justice (“climate-just Ocean commitments”). The challenges and opportunities inherent in implementing climate-just Ocean commitments require a comprehensive review of the latest innovations in blue carbon scientific research, the enabling conditions necessary for uptake of this science into policies and decision making, and the financial structures needed to equitably finance Ocean nature-based solutions. Responding to this need, we propose that a framework is needed to support the inclusion of blue carbon sequestration potential in ambitious national and subnational action. The proposed framework should center on the intersectionality of climate justice with the three key layers essential to implementation of Ocean commitments—science, law, and economics—where traditional and local ecological knowledge is valued on par with western science, law and policy centers on vulnerable communities, and financial mechanisms respect national sovereignty, value local cultures, and support sustainable economic development. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1017/sus.2021.25;"Non-technical summary We summarize some of the past year's most important findings within climate change-related research. New research has improved our understanding about the remaining options to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, through overcoming political barriers to carbon pricing, taking into account non-CO2 factors, a well-designed implementation of demand-side and nature-based solutions, resilience building of ecosystems and the recognition that climate change mitigation costs can be justified by benefits to the health of humans and nature alone. We consider new insights about what to expect if we fail to include a new dimension of fire extremes and the prospect of cascading climate tipping elements. Technical summary A synthesis is made of 10 topics within climate research, where there have been significant advances since January 2020. The insights are based on input from an international open call with broad disciplinary scope. Findings include: (1) the options to still keep global warming below 1.5 °C; (2) the impact of non-CO2 factors in global warming; (3) a new dimension of fire extremes forced by climate change; (4) the increasing pressure on interconnected climate tipping elements; (5) the dimensions of climate justice; (6) political challenges impeding the effectiveness of carbon pricing; (7) demand-side solutions as vehicles of climate mitigation; (8) the potentials and caveats of nature-based solutions; (9) how building resilience of marine ecosystems is possible; and (10) that the costs of climate change mitigation policies can be more than justified by the benefits to the health of humans and nature.

10.3390/su131810162;"Scholars of gender and climate change argue that gender-blind climate change actions could exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine sustained climate change adaptation actions. For this reason, since 2017, the Green Climate Fund placed gender among its key programming prerequisites, making it the first multilateral climate fund to do so worldwide. However, to date, no lessons to inform planned gender-responsive ecosystem-based interventions in Namibia have been drawn from community-based natural resource management. Thus, this paper aims to share key lessons regarding the way in which gender assessment is useful in enhancing equity in an eco-system-based adaptation programme for the Green Climate Fund. To this end, we conducted in-depth interviews and group discussions in the 14 rural regions of Namibia with 151 participants from 107 community-based natural resource management organisations (73.5:26.5; male:female ra-tio). The results identified gender imbalances in leadership and decision-making due to intersecting historic inequalities, ethnicity and geography, as well as other socio-cultural factors in local com-munity-based natural resource management institutions. We also identified income disparities and unequal opportunities to diversify livelihoods, gendered differentiated impacts of climate change and meaningful participation in public forums. Overall, the assessment indicates that considering gender analysis at the initiation of a community-based climate change adaptation project is crucial for achieving resilience to climate change, closing the gender gap, building capacity to increase equity and empowering women in resource-dependent environments in Namibia and Sub-Saharan Africa more broadly. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3390/su13179672;Nature-based solutions (NBS) are currently being deployed in many European Commission Horizon 2020 projects in reaction to the increasing number of environmental threats, such as climate change, unsustainable urbanization, degradation and loss of natural capital and ecosystem services. In this research, we consider the application of NBS as a catalyst for social inclusivity in urban regeneration strategies, enabled through civic participation in the co-creation of green interventions with respect to social cohesion and wellbeing. This article is focused on a social monitoring framework elaborated within the H2020 CLEVER Cities project, with the city of Milan as a case study. Firstly, we overviewed the major regeneration challenges and expected co-benefits of the project, which are mainly human health and wellbeing, social cohesion and environmental justice, as well as citizen perception about safety and security related to the NBS implementation process. Secondly, we examined the relevance of using NBS in addressing social co-benefits by analyzing data from questionnaires against a set of five major indicators, submitted to citizens and participants of activities during pre-greening interventions: (1) Place, use of space and relationship with nature, (2) Perceived ownership and sense of belonging, (3) Psychosocial issues, social interactions and social cohesion, (4) Citizen perception about safety and security, and lastly, we analyzed (5) knowledge about CLEVER interventions and NBS benefits in relation to socio-demographics of the questionnaires’ respondents. Thirdly, we cross-referenced a wind-rose multi-model of co-benefits analysis for NBS across the regeneration challenges of the project. Because of the COVID-19 emer-gency, in this research we mainly focused on site observations and online questionnaires, as well as on monitoring pre-greening scenarios in three Urban Living Labs (ULLs) in Milan, namely CLEVER Action Labs. Lastly, this study emphasizes the expected social added values of NBS impact over long-term urban regeneration projects. Insights from the pre-greening surveys results accentuate the importance of the NBS interventions in citizens’ perceptions about their wellbeing, general health and strong sense of neighborhood belonging. A wider interest towards civic participation in co-management and getting informed about NBS interventions in the Milanese context is also noted. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1002/eap.2390;Livability, resilience, and justice in cities are challenged by climate change and the historical legacies that together create disproportionate impacts on human communities. Urban green infrastructure has emerged as an important tool for climate change adaptation and resilience given their capacity to provide ecosystem services such as local temperature regulation, stormwater mitigation, and air purification. However, realizing the benefits of ecosystem services for climate adaptation depend on where they are locally supplied. Few studies have examined the potential spatial mismatches in supply and demand of urban ecosystem services, and even fewer have examined supply–demand mismatches as a potential environmental justice issue, such as when supply–demand mismatches disproportionately overlap with certain socio-demographic groups. We spatially analyzed demand for ecosystem services relevant for climate change adaptation and combined results with recent analysis of the supply of ecosystem services in New York City (NYC). By quantifying the relative mismatch between supply and demand of ecosystem services across the city we were able to identify spatial hot- and coldspots of supply–demand mismatch. Hotspots are spatial clusters of census blocks with a higher mismatch and coldspots are clusters with lower mismatch values than their surrounding blocks. The distribution of mismatch hot- and coldspots was then compared to the spatial distribution of socio-demographic groups. Results reveal distributional environmental injustice of access to the climate-regulating benefits of ecosystem services provided by urban green infrastructure in NYC. Analyses show that areas with lower supply–demand mismatch tend to be populated by a larger proportion of white residents with higher median incomes, and areas with high mismatch values have lower incomes and a higher proportion of people of color. We suggest that urban policy and planning should ensure that investments in “nature-based” solutions such as through urban green infrastructure for climate change adaptation do not reinforce or exacerbate potentially existing environmental injustices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3389/fclim.2021.630075;The structural research programmes of the European Union dedicated to advance the sustainability sciences are increasingly permeated by the notion of transdisciplinarity (TD). A growing body of literature residing at the intersection of research methodology and sustainability studies can guide researchers to adopt appropriate research approaches in their projects. However, how to implement the transdisciplinary approach in multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder projects that develop in different countries for several years is still relatively undocumented. This study seeks to fill this gap by sharing the experience of a group of researchers and stakeholders involved in the Horizon 2020 research and innovation project Nature-Based Urban Innovation (NATURVATION). The article discusses the monitoring and evaluation strategy that employed four criteria of transdisciplinary research quality as “reflexive devices” to enable a systematic reporting on the project's most important collaborative activities. By examining how the four criteria captured transdisciplinary quality, new insights were produced for improving this monitoring and evaluation strategy for future transdisciplinary research, allowing a number of concrete recommendations to be formulated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s13280-020-01365-1;Nature-based solutions (NBS) find increasing attention as actions to address societal challenges through harnessing ecological processes, yet knowledge gaps exist regarding approaches to landscape planning with NBS. This paper aims to provide suggestions of how planning NBS can be conceptualized and applied in practice. We develop a framework for planning NBS by merging insights from literature and a case study in the Lahn river landscape, Germany. Our framework relates to three key criteria that define NBS, and consists of six steps of planning: Co-define setting, Understand challenges, Create visions and scenarios, Assess potential impacts, Develop solution strategies, and Realize and monitor. Its implementation is guided by five principles, namely Place-specificity, Evidence base, Integration, Equity, and Transdisciplinarity. Drawing on the empirical insights from the case study, we suggest suitable methods and a checklist of supportive procedures for applying the framework in practice. Taken together, our framework can facilitate planning NBS and provides further steps towards mainstreaming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s11269-021-02840-4;Sustainable urban drainage systems are multi-functional nature-based solutions that can facilitate flood management in urban catchments while improving stormwater runoff quality. Traditionally, the evaluation of the performance of sustainable drainage infrastructure has been limited to a narrow set of design objectives to simplify their implementation and decision-making process. In this study, the spatial design of sustainable urban drainage systems is optimized considering five objective functions, including minimization of flood volume, flood duration, average peak runoff, total suspended solids, and capital cost. This allows selecting an ensemble of admissible portfolios that best trade-off capital costs and the other important urban drainage services. The impact of the average surface slope of the urban catchment on the optimal design solutions is discussed in terms of spatial distribution of sustainable drainage types. Results show that different subcatchment slopes result in non-uniform distributional designs of sustainable urban drainage systems, with higher capital costs and larger surface areas of green assets associated with steeper slopes. This has two implications. First, urban areas with different surface slopes should not have a one-size-fits-all design policy. Second, spatial equality must be taken into account when applying optimization models to urban subcatchments with different surface slopes to avoid unequal distribution of environmental and human health co-benefits associated with green drainage infrastructure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/ijerph18115763;The built environment is a physical determinant of health essential to the planning and development of a more equitable society. Communities face growing challenges due to environmental stressors such as climate change, with vulnerable communities experiencing a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. The interdependencies between urban planning and public health outcomes are inextricable, with respect to improving access to healthier built environments for vulnerable and marginalized groups. Widespread implementation of nature-based solutions, such as green infrastructure, provides a multi-functional strategy to support sustainable development, increase climate resilience, enhance ecological connectivity, and create healthier communities. A Health Equity Impact Assessment presents the findings of a participatory research study utilizing key informant interviews of public health unit professionals (eight) and a survey of green infrastructure volunteers and workers (36) on the impact of green infrastructure on individual and community mental and physical well-being, service use, and perceived unmet needs, using Ontario, Canada as a case study. Study findings indicate that where green infrastructure is both productive and publicly accessible, the benefits were significant for vulnerable populations. These benefits include increased social connectivity, skills development, and food security. Green infrastructure could be a viable strategy to address environmental stressors, improve health equity, and support localization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2021.103155;"Different ways of thinking and understanding urban problems and imagining solutions are needed to redress the suite of serious challenges facing cities. Focusing on urban nature, this conceptual paper begins from the standpoint that nature-based solutions (NBS) could help remake cities as places for more than just people; in other words, cities could encourage the flourishing of multiple species and ecosystems, including but not limited to, humans. Although cities were once considered ‘biodiversity wastelands’, they are now recognised as providing important habitat. However, NBS have been plagued by criticisms of anthropocentrism whereby human needs are prioritised over those of other species and ecosystems. To overcome this problem, the paper provides an outline of more-than-human thinking and suggests how relational concepts can help NBS move beyond an inherent anthropocentrism, and also begins to work through some of the complexities of making this shift. More-than-human thinking and theories have arisen in several disciplines, but despite a considerable presence in the literature, they have not yet been brought into conversation with NBS. The paper concludes that more-than-human thinking can generate deeper understanding of the interdependencies between all the entities that comprise cities, such that more inclusive NBS could be implemented. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3389/frsc.2021.669944;The design and deployment of green amenities is a way to tackle cities' socio-environmental problems in the quest for urban sustainability. In this study, we undertake a systematic review of research published in international peer-reviewed journals that analyzes environmental justice issues within the context of the deployment of urban green amenities. Since most studies focus on the Global North, where this scholarship first emerged, our goal is to link the literature focused on the North and the South. This study aims to outline similarities and differences regarding the nexus of justice and the greening of cities in both contexts as well as to identify knowledge gaps in this scholarship in the Global South. “Green infrastructure” and “nature-based solutions,” as the leading concepts for cities' greening agendas, are used as descriptors in combination with “justice” and/or “green gentrification” in searches undertaken of two bibliographic databases. Our results show there is a need to better delineate a research agenda that addresses such issues in a heterogeneous Global South context while gaining insights from advances made by research on the Global North. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102248;"Interest in nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation in cities is growing. Whilst there is a growing field of scholarship in a European and North America setting, research on the policy and governance of urban greenspace for climate adaptation in subtropical Asia is limited. Given the different development patterns, environmental characteristics and governance arrangements in subtropical cities, plus their comparatively large population and high climate risk, this is a significant knowledge gap. In response, this paper evaluates competences – skill sets, capabilities, and supporting policy and legislation – to enact adaptation through greenspace across different governance contexts; and assesses how international rhetoric on nature-based adaptation becomes localised to subtropical Asian city settings. We conduct interviews with stakeholders, plus review of relevant policy and city-specific research, for three cities with different governance and development contexts: Hanoi (Vietnam); Taipei (Taiwan); and Fukuoka (Japan). Across all three cases, we find that institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems are a bigger challenge than a lack of appropriate policy or individuals with the required technical knowledge. However, opportunities for civil society participation and consideration of justice issues vary between the cities according to the socio-political context. These findings illustrate the value of individuals and organisations able to work across institutional boundaries in linking greenspace and adaptation agendas for subtropical Asian cities; and the importance of competence in collaboration with developers and civil society so that the rapid development or regeneration seen in subtropical Asian contexts does not tend towards green climate gentrification. More broadly, our findings show that the diverse nature of subtropical Asian cities means the role of greenspace in climate adaptation is likely to be context-specific, and thus that caution must be exercised against uncritically importing best practices from exemplar cases elsewhere. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105361;Social-ecological justice is an emerging field that argues for nature's agency, social-ecological awareness, recognition of nature's capabilities, and participation in decision-making processes. A social-ecological justice perspective lifts the analysis out of a distribution of environmental impacts to humans, to a recognition of social-ecological complexities. However, bringing this perspective to urban planning requires a suite of methods and tools in coordination with existing planning methods that do not address issues of social-ecological justice, or, justice for nature. Drawing from existing methods and tools, this paper presents a novel methodology to define, identify, and map social-ecological injustices in urban landscapes. Three dimensions of social-ecological justice (distribution, recognition, and participation) are operationalised into a set of indicators, which are added to create a Social-Ecological Injustices Index that identifies place hotspots. A fourth dimension, capabilities, is discussed, but not operationalised in the paper. The urban region of Melbourne, which has been undergoing intense urbanisation processes, is used as a case study to test the applicability of this index. The geospatial analysis reveals various degrees of social-ecological injustices across the Melbourne Metropolitan region and unveils the location of the most deprived areas. This methodology can be applied as a systematic and effective way for urban planners and decision-makers to identify and target social-ecological injustice hotspots as areas of prioritisation for urban regeneration with nature-based solutions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

10.3390/su13073876;Nature-based solutions (NBS) are an innovative concept that mimics the processes of natural ecosystems, popularized principally in the European Union. With a substantial body of literature amassed since the term’s inception in 2015, there is a need to systematically review existing literature to identify overarching gaps and trends, according to disciplinary focus, geographic scope, and key themes, and direct future research inquiry and policy recommendations. This review consists of bibliometric analysis and thematic analysis for NBS studies in urbanism. NBS studies were found to relate strongly with other concepts of ‘Ecosystem Services’, ‘Green Infrastructure’, ‘Climate Change’, and ‘Risk management and Resilience’, which align with four major thematic goals set by the European Commission. Within NBS scholarship, various sub-themes have emerged, namely, ‘Greening’, ‘Urban Development’, ‘Water’, ‘Wellbeing’, and ‘Governance’. Furthermore, we illustrate that the amount and thematic focus of NBS research have been unevenly distributed worldwide. Analysis of emerging trends shows a recent increase in topics, such as adaptive governance of NBS, and the incorporation of social justice in sustainability transitions. Based on an assessment of extant NBS literature, we offer some recommendations for the future direction of the research fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125569;Urban areas are expanding due to rural-urban migration and due to population increases. Their resilience is being challenged due to socio-political consequences of increasingly frequent and severe storms, due to climate changes, influx of human and animal refugees and as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors prepared a systematic literature of ways cities can be transformed into more resilient, and sustainable regions by creatively enhancing the quality and quantity of blue and green areas in and around them. The literature review was conducted to provide holistic insights into selection, implementation monitoring, assessment, and valuation of Nature-based Solutions in diverse urban regions. The authors reviewed no fewer than 298 articles from 109 academic journals and related sources, published within 1997–2020. The focus of the articles was upon ‘nature-based’ changes that are being implemented in urban areas, globally to enhance their resilience and the ‘quality-of-life’ of humans and other species. By implementing nature-based solutions, and complimentary ‘urban wilding’ approaches, urban areas and their hinterlands are expanding their ‘blue’ and ‘green’ areas and are thereby decreasing the ‘heat-island’ effects, while improving human health by surrounding them with rich bio-diversities of locally adapted, aquatic and terrestrial plants and animals. Although, many NBS options have been documented to be beneficial, their environmental, economic and social/psychological dimensions have not been adequately quantified, especially in the context of climate changes, and with regard to COVID-19. It is essential that the benefits of NBS are quantified with easily measurable outcomes, that are readily understood by practitioners, city policy-makers and members of community organizations, based upon specific geographical and climatological contexts. This will help them accelerate implementation of NBS and wilding into their urban systems. The reviewers found that more research is needed on anticipatory learning, backcasting and community participation to help to effectively implement the appropriate NBS for improving the sustainability of urban systems. The reviewers provide guidance for urban leaders to incorporate NBS into their policies and strategies to improve urban resilience and equity and to more effectively reduce impacts of climate change, population growth and pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/land10030298;Nature-based solutions (NbS) include all the landscape’s ecological components that have a function in the natural or urban ecosystem. Memorial Parking Trees (MPTs) are a new variant of a nature-based solution composed of a bioswale and a street tree allocated in the road, occupying a space that is sub-utilised by parked cars. This infill green practice can maximise the use of street trees in secondary streets and have multiple benefits in our communities. Using GIS mapping and methodology can support implementation in vulnerable neighbourhoods. In this research, we based vulnerability assessments for London, Rio de Janeiro, and Los Angeles on the following three indi-cators: extreme temperature, air quality, and flood-prone areas. Evidence is emerging that disad-vantaged populations may live at higher risks of exposure to environmental hazards [1]. The income and healthcare accessibility of neighbourhoods are the two indicators that will help us target these communities for a better and faster decision-making process. The contrast between the results and the 15-min city concept supports our detecting and prioritising neighbourhoods for MPTS imple-mentation, among other NbS solutions integrated into a more inclusive and sustainable urban de-sign. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106874;"Nature-based solutions are quickly rising to the top of the sustainable urban development agenda as an ecosystem-based approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change, while also improving livelihoods and biodiversity. Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions—approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.3389/frsc.2020.583833;With their potential to effectively address multiple urban sustainability challenges, the emerging policy discourse on nature-based solutions seeks to encourage the development of multifunctional nature for sustainable and just cities. Nature-based solutions, however, are vulnerable to co-option by powerful interests in ways that limit their contribution to a broad range of sustainability goals. Reflexive governance arrangements between different types of actors, engaging in continuous and iterative processes of learning and readjustment of institutions and practices, provide a way to address this issue. However, the potential of reflexive governance in increasing commitment to sustainable and just cities, and the role of power struggles in such processes, remains underexplored. To study this question, we undertake a comparative case study analysis of nature-based solutions in Utrecht (The Netherlands), Malmö (Sweden), and Utsunomiya (Japan). These are analyzed using a framework structured around the dimensions of system analysis, goal formulation, and strategy implementation, to which we apply a justice lens. The findings demonstrate reflexive processes in each of the studied cases, but the justice dimension is not always explicitly taken into account or clearly influenced in positive ways. We unveil tensions between the ideal of sustainable and just cities and the reality of urban nature-based solution initiatives being partially dependent on the power structures they seek to influence for their continued existence. We argue against dismissing the studied cases as neoliberal projects on these grounds. Reflexive governance for sustainable and just cities entails a continuous struggle for dominance between different ideas and interests. Moreover, the battlegrounds for these struggles may look very different across sociopolitical contexts. Provided that justice considerations are continually present, reflexive governance of urban nature-based solutions is likely to contribute to more sustainable and just cities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1108/978-1-80043-636-720211028;New York City, the most dense and populous city in the United States, is one of the world’s most altered landscapes. Yet, New York City boasts an urban ecology which produces invaluable environmental benefits. The extent and vitality of its green and blue spaces would not be where it is without the unrelenting organization, stewardship, and advocacy of the New York citizenry. Born from these grassroots environmental justice movements, citizens have built the nature-based solutions (NBS) they seek out of oft-neglected landscapes and vacant lots. Today, over 800 civic environmental stewardship groups are active across all of New York City’s 205,000 acres. These groups directly manage, restore, and conserve greenspaces, as well as advocate for their investment and expand ecological awareness through educational programming and campaigns, and their work is more important as ever, with the growing impacts of climate change. This chapter will review three cases of community environmental stewardship, including a distributed community garden movement, restoration of a polluted waterway, and an emerging framework for adaptive coastal protection. Through these cases, we may understand the origins and frontiers of some of today’s civic networks stewarding New York City’s natural areas. These cases emphasize a socioecological view of the city’s ecology. They show that we must consider green infrastructure and natural resources as places which have social and cultural meaning, not merely spaces with ecological functions. They highlight the labor and investments committed by community groups which require compensation and nurturing. Lastly, they demonstrate the importance of supporting social networks and local capacities in stewarding nature-based strategies and building resilient, adaptive, and equitable socioecological systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/B978-0-12-819871-1.00016-6;Healthy ecosystems are intricately connected to healthy communities and human well-being. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are an important tool for water security, while also providing additional human health, climate mitigation, and livelihood benefits that contribute to multiple Sustainable Development Goals. NBS also play out in landscapes of current and historical injustices. Without explicit consideration of equity and justice, NBS risk exacerbating inequities, rather than contributing to a more just society. In this chapter, we discuss the importance of attention to distributional, procedural, and recognitional equity in NBS and review examples of real-world NBS programs and strategies to improve equity and justice outcomes. Specifically, we discuss urban green infrastructure, payments for ecosystem services, and biocultural approaches to watershed management. We conclude with emerging best practices around equitable and just NBS for water. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/B978-0-12-819871-1.00013-0;In this chapter, the authors review what is known about urban blue spaces, health, and well-being. Urban blue spaces are made up of multiple typologies, spanning natural, seminatural and manmade, in the form of rivers, coast, lakes, canals, ponds, and sustainable drainage features. Urban blue space research is more limited than green space research but is a growing field that is proposing nuanced benefits and challenges of how urban water bodies can contribute to health and well-being. The authors summarize this research and include anthropological and environmental justice reflections on people’s engagement with urban water bodies. They summarize work from a local blue space project in East London focused on local community and place and suggest some innovative ways of engaging constructively with urban blue spaces that could offer opportunities for creatively using blue space-focused nature-based solutions to enhance the climate resilience and beauty of urban areas, while also positively impacting health and well-being of people and the urban environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1108/978-1-80043-636-720211018;"Public spaces within our cities are being redefined through a wide range of nature-based solutions (NBS) including green spaces. In this chapter, we will focus on public green spaces in the wider sense. If well planned and managed, green spaces can promote social inclusiveness by enhancing the livebility of neighborhoods and promoting the development of social interactions. The creation of new green space does not automatically lead to socially just and inclusive development; co-benefits should be available and accessible to the entire community. Prejudices, marginalization, and discrimination on socioeconomic condition, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, or disability still prevent the equitable distribution of these benefits and need to be fully understood before any planning process is undertaken. The governance of public green spaces is still viewed primarily as a matter for the state or as a purely private activity. It is important, therefore, to identify ways to ensure the integrated and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors, as is shown in some examples from different countries. The planning and design of green interventions should start with the evaluation of existing or potential trade-offs between environmental and social development. Urban green spaces must be designed as places for multiple and diverse social groups. If all these issues are duly considered and addressed, NBS can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce co-benefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban development and making our cities green, healthier, and happier places to live. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.48088/ejg.w.bau.12.2.074.089;The present research paper aims to analyze the spatial results of the expansion that Brazilian Federal Universities Network have presented between 2003 and 2018, looking forward the impacts and possibilities towards the achievement of urban and regional sustainable development. In economically obsolete or marginalized areas or in those with strong industrial dynamism or agribusiness production, these new campuses also can be understood as vehicles to promote economic security/growth, social equity and assure environmental integrity. Focusing in two empirical studies, based in qualitative and quantitative methodologies, besides the theoretical approach, in cities and regions of Bahia state which received two new universities, we present the economic contribution of the new campuses, the challenges and strategies to socially develop places with high amount of vulnerable population, and the environmental potentialities to build green campus, understood as a nature-based solution, and to implement the Sustainable Developing Goals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-030-67650-6_13;Over the last decade, the need to advance urban resilience research and practice has been emphasised, especially for safeguarding important ecosystem services that are critical for human wellbeing in and around cities. The pace and scale of changes in the Anthropocene make this imperative even more pressing, especially within the context of rapid urbanisation, infrastructure deficits and rising inequalities in the Global South. In this chapter, we contribute to these advances by highlighting the value of taking a social-ecological resilience approach to understanding the contested nature of urban resilience from multiple perspectives. We discuss important principles for exploring and building resilience and how these principles can be used within the context of urban resilience using two examples from the Global South. This chapter also outlines how an intersectionality approach can advance conceptualisation and implementation of resilience by focusing explicitly on how power mediates certain relationships and interdependencies in social-ecological systems. Foregrounding the role of power can assist with better understanding the opportunities for adaptation and transformation and ‘putting the last, first’ in resilience research and practice. We conclude by exploring some key gaps, blindspots and opportunities for a research-action agenda for urban resilience going forward. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/978-3-030-59320-9_21;Environmental law is a main pillar of European Union construction. It has changed throughout the decades to encompass the new visions and strategies for Europe, towards a more sustainable future. We analyse a number of EU legal documents to assess the development of several concepts throughout the decades, pinpointing the key challenges throughout the evolution. If at the beginning of the period in appreciation key principles of openness, equity and accountability are important in the legal documents, they seldom appear in more recent documents, where the recently coined challenges of circular economy, nature-based solution and new green business models are more dominant. Climate change and risk assessment and management are pervasive topics, witnessing the European Union concern with these matters for several decades. The vertical and horizontal integration with international institutions and with the member countries and European regions is also a dominant worry of European environmental legislation, providing the freedom for adaptation to the local and national cultural and societal characteristics. In fact, in contrast to the commonly believed by the citizens, due to the subsidiary principle, the enforcement of European legislation is performed, in an adapted manner at country level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1007/s42532-020-00065-0;Green infrastructure is being pulled in divergent directions. As climate impacts intensify, advocates are promoting larger, ecosystem-scale strategies to help mitigate flood risks. Yet, research on existing urban greening projects finds that they can cause gentrification and displacement, suggesting that smaller projects may be more desirable from an equity perspective. This essay argues that cities need both large-scale and justice-enhancing nature-based solutions. They can help overcome tensions in these goals by (1) reframing green infrastructure as a way to support community development and integrated socio-ecological landscapes, and (2) advancing metropolitan regional governance strategies that alleviate municipal fiscal imperatives to maximize local land development. These proposals suggest that the practice of green infrastructure would benefit from diversifying its ranks to include social and government policy, community development, and agroecology, as well as learning from the Global South and those currently positioned as “off the map” of technical expertise. They also point to the need for interdisciplinary research that provides an evidence base for more transformative social, ecological, and governance strategies. While the essay focuses on the US context, it is relevant to an international audience given that similar challenges confront cities worldwide and that it highlights how the Global North can learn from the Global South. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/f11121246;Present-day dense cities are increasingly affected by the impacts associated with climate change. The recurrence of extreme climate events is projected to be intensified in cities in the next decades, especially in the most vulnerable areas of the world, such as the Mediterranean region. In this context, the urban green infrastructure (UGI) is presented as a nature-based solution that directly contributes to climate change mitigation in Mediterranean compact cities and improves health, social, welfare, and environmental conditions for inhabitants. This research sets out a manageable framework to define, locate, and categorize more functional green urban and peri-urban areas in a dense Mediterranean city. It takes spatial distribution, extension, and the capacity to improve inhabitants’ wellbeing through the provision of ecosystem services as classification criteria. Results show a scenario with a greater functional green surface available for the citizens to be managed. Identified areas have been categorized as cores, nodes, links, and green spaces defined as “other” areas. In particular, the latter play a significant role at social, structural, and ecological levels. The study showcases that rethinking urban design and strategic decision-making around these areas can enhance green equity in Mediterranean dense cities, their capacity to better deal with environmental extremes, and the inhabitants’ engagement with a culture of sustainability and wellbeing. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1186/s13750-020-00208-6;Background: The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept to describe approaches to learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems. Furthermore, NBS often address multiple societal challenges that humans are facing in the medium to long-term and as such can enhance human well-being (HWB). This study was commissioned to fulfil the need for a targeted systematic evidence map on the linkage between NBS and HWB to support focused research going forward that addresses the key knowledge needs of policy makers in the UK and beyond. Methods: A consultation with policy makers and government agency staff (n = 46), in the four component parts of the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) was conducted in spring 2019. This identified four key societal challenges of operational experience lacking a scientific evidence base. Three of these challenges related to management issues: NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice. The fourth challenge related to the acoustic environment (soundscape). Using systematic methods, this study searched for and identified studies that assessed NBS on HWB with regard to these four selected societal challenges. Review findings: A total of 7287 articles were returned from the systematic search and screened for suitability at the level of title and abstract. A total of 610 articles passed screening criteria to warrant full text screening. Of these, 115 studies met the full text criteria for eligibility in the final systematic map database. Included studies were coded for twelve NBS interventions and ten HWB related outcome categories. Most of the evidence reviewed referred to natural, blue or green infrastructure in the urban environment and focused on economic, material and health aspects of HWB. Less than 2% of studies identified in the searches robustly reported the role of NBS actions or interventions on HWB compared with non-NBS actions or interventions Conclusion: This systematic map found the evidence base is growing on NBS-HWB linkages, but significant biases persist in the existing literature. There was a bias in favour of the urban environment and restoration studies focused on conservation aspects, with only a few studies investigating the full suite of advantages to HWB that can be delivered from NBS actions and interventions. The soundscape was the least studied of the societal challenges identified as being of key importance by policy makers, with cost-efficiency the most reported. There was a lack of robust long-term studies to clearly test the potential of NBS regarding the HWB outcomes compared with non-NBS alternatives. This lack of robust primary knowledge, covering all four key societal challenges identified, confirms that the knowledge gaps identified by the policy makers persist, and highlights a clear research need for long-term, transdisciplinary studies that focus on comparisons between NBS and non-NBS alternatives. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1088/1755-1315/588/5/052003;The manifold social, cultural and health benefits of urban community gardens have received much attention in the literature on urban ecosystem services and nature-based solutions off late. Despite recognition of these benefits by many city governments, critical scholarship in urban political ecology has, however, also shown that urban community gardens can stand in tension with other municipal agendas, in which economic growth is prioritized over social justice. While highlighting some of these tensions, in this paper we pay particular attention to possibilities for cooperation with municipalities and to the possibilities of promoting more inclusive urban citizenship. In the past, community gardens were frequently set up by municipalities for urban residents to respond to food scarcity and public health issues. Today, they are often still founded in periods of socio-economic crisis either by municipalities or by community actors themselves. We discuss whether and if so, how, such a cooperation may promote substantive citizenship rights, while highlighting some of the tensions that counteract this aim. The paper draws on case studies conducted as part of the EU-Horizon2020-funded project NATURVATION (Grant Agreement 730243) and suggests methods for citizen engagement that municipalities can adopt in order to enhance participation in the cooperative development of urban community gardens. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102132;Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in high-level, decision-making arenas as a response to global policy challenges. Claiming to be transformative and pluralistic, NbS aim to resolve societal problems through a focus on nature, which is understood to be a benign ally. This uncritical framing of nature may have unintended and inequitable consequences that undermine the emancipatory potential of NbS. In this paper, we highlight the need to pay attention to epistemic and power dimensions that tend to be hidden in NbS. We assume that nature is neither passive nor external to human society, but is instead expressed in frames (reifying modes of expression) that reflect both knowledge and power in social encounters where NbS are used. Drawing upon five cases, we analyse how particular ways of framing nature express and reinforce the power relations that structure people's interactions. Each of the five cases relies on a nature-based frame to produce knowledge on climate adaptation, peacebuilding and justice. The analysis reveals how frames of nature are enacted in particular contexts, and how this conditions the potential for societal transformation towards sustainability and pluralistic knowledge. We demonstrate how frames of nature can constrain or enable opportunities for various groups to respond to environmental change. We discuss how the NbS paradigm might better incorporate diverse, situated knowledge and subjectivities, and conclude that this will require a more critical evaluation of NbS practice and research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.watres.2020.116411;"Cities are wrestling with the practical challenges of transitioning urban water services to become water sensitive; capable of enhancing liveability, sustainability, resilience and productivity in the face of climate change, rapid urbanisation, degraded ecosystems and ageing infrastructure. Indicators can be valuable for guiding actions for improvement, but there is not yet an established index that measures the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance. This paper therefore presents the Water Sensitive Cities (WSC) Index, a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool to assess the water sensitivity of a municipal or metropolitan city, set aspirational targets and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices. Its 34 indicators are organised into seven goals: ensure good water sensitive governance, increase community capital, achieve equity of essential services, improve productivity and resource efficiency, improve ecological health, ensure quality urban spaces, and promote adaptive infrastructure. The WSC Index design is a quantitative framework based on qualitative rating descriptions and a participatory assessment methodology, enabling local contextual interpretations of the indicators while maintaining a robust universal framework for city comparison and benchmarking. The paper demonstrates its application on three illustrative cases. Rapid uptake of the WSC Index in Australia highlights its value in helping stakeholders develop collective commitment and evidence-based priorities for action to accelerate their city's water sensitive transition. Early testing in cities in Asia, the Pacific and South Africa has also showed the potential of the WSC Index internationally. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.cities.2020.102839;"Hybrid (or multi-actor) governance has been identified as a key opportunity for upscaling urban nature-based solutions (referred to as urban NBS), representing a demand-driven and cost-effective realization of urban green infrastructure. However it is unclear how such hybrid governance affects the justice outcomes of urban NBS. Through six in-depth cases of urban NBS we show that hybrid governance can lead to both improvements and deterioration of distributional, procedural and recognition justice, depending on the hybrid governance choices. By exploring the tensions between these justice impacts we formulate three main policy implications for hybrid governance settings: the need for transparent decision-making on the distribution of costs and benefits; safeguarding public control over the urban NBS and the use of scientific expertise in combination with bottom-up consultation procedures to recognize both current and future voices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.envsci.2020.06.024;Although green interventions, like nature-based solutions, contribute to more sustainable urban environments and provide ecosystem services to urban populations, some impacts are not well understood. This particularly applies to social impacts in the domain of environmental justice, including (green) gentrification. Gentrification refers to a process in which green urban renewal raises property prices, which results in an influx of affluent people, displacing poorer residents. Our study conducts a meta-analysis based on 37 primary hedonic pricing studies, to estimate value transfer functions that can assess the effects of nature types on property prices in various urban settings. Urban nature has positive impacts on house value in the areas surrounding it, which depend on population density, distance to, and the type of, urban nature. We illustrate how the estimated benefit transfer function can be applied to natural interventions in a Dutch city, and visualize the obtained effects using mapping. These maps show the distance decay of the cumulative effects of urban nature interventions on the house value at the city and the neighbourhood levels. Our application estimated increases in local property values up to a maximum of 20 % compared with properties not affected by the interventions, with value equivalent of 62,650 USD, at average prevailing price level in a particular area in Utrecht. When new nature is being planned in urban areas our mapping approach can be used for guiding assessments of potential undesirable effects on property values that may lead to green gentrification, and for identifying where additional policies may be needed to contribute to environmental justice. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cosust.2020.09.001;Globally, rising seas, coastal erosion, extended dry periods, and flooding contribute to decreased water security and increased disaster incidence. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are increasingly advanced as innovative responses to promote adaptation and build resilience, and they are arguably more sustainable than traditional gray infrastructure. There is a growing body of information regarding the material, social, and technological advances that constitute NBS and the ways in which nature can complement traditional built infrastructure. However, critical gaps remain. Promoting a coupled systems approach, we explore fundamental challenges, including issues of participation and equity, economic valuation, scalar mismatches, the integration of natural and built infrastructure, and governance. NBS do not entail quick solutions, and to reach their full potential NBS require a fundamental rethinking of society's relationship with nature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1423/97800;This article contributes to the debate on water (re)socialisation by looking at contemporary Dutch flood management, which suggests a paradigm shift by giving land back to water: ontpoldering. Focusing on the case of the island Tiengemeten, a place «given back to nature» and water, we explore which actors define nature and how much space and time nature and water receive, as well as the implications of these processes for humans and non-humans. To understand these processes we propose the notion of naturification, analyzed in light of social, environmental and ecological justice theories. This brought us to the conclusion that awareness is needed for the side effects of this promising increase in ecological justice: the disruption of community fabric and a loss of diverse ways of defining and relating to nature and water. Material for this research has been collected through multispecies ethnography consisting of participatory observation, participatory mapping and semi-structured interviews. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103775;Green Infrastructure (GI) is defined as a network of natural and semi-natural areas that is strategically designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to enhance human wellbeing. In Europe, the GI concept has been strongly related to the concepts of multifunctionality, climate change, and green growth, particularly in the last decade, leading to a research and policy agenda that varies greatly, targeting different audiences and topics. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of the key characteristics of GI research by focusing on the countries of the European Union. We consider the conceptualizations of GI, key research priorities, and thematic clusters within the existing literature. We demonstrate that the ambiguous definition of GI has generated a high diversity in research objectives and outputs. We also show that urban green spaces and ecosystems services are the most frequent topics and that more research is needed on the social aspects of GI. We suggest that an explicit incorporation of both nature conservation and social-environmental justice goals is essential for GI research to support sustainability transitions within and beyond the city. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scs.2019.101885;There is a rising demand to use nature and natural processes to address a different range of urban issues, especially when looking at the risk of pluvial flood associated with climate changes and urbanization processes. Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1080/21550085.2020.1746002;The importance and urgency of using ethical principles in the creation and content of climate change policy is well recognised. This article closely examines the World Conservation Union’s (IUCN) engagement in ethical elements of international climate policy for abatement. The primary finding is the use of narrow framing around ‘nature based solutions’. The IUCNs’ own policy references to ethical principles such as fairness and justice are not adequately applied to the content of policy or to its critique. Recommendations are made on how the IUCN (and NGOs generally) could enhance its ethical engagement to act consistently with the claim of moral leadership. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.mex.2020.100984;"In this era of climate change, novel nature-based solutions, like the daylighting (de-culverting) of streams, that enhance the socio-ecological resilience are gaining prominence. Yet, the growing body of literature on stream daylighting spreads over an array of seemingly disconnected disciplines and lacks consistency in the terminology and the definitions of the practice. Moreover, nearly all the literature review studies on stream daylighting (mostly produced since 2000) underscore, as their point of departure, the daylighting projects rather than a review of the literature's content per se. Therefore, this study reassesses the literature on stream daylighting with a particular focus on its role, as a nature-based solution, for climate change mitigation and adaptation and for socio-environmental justice. We combine the systematic literature review (an all-encompassing review of the available literature on stream daylighting) with the inductive content analysis (an in-depth analysis of this literature's nature). Accordingly, we investigate all the relevant English-language publications since the first peer reviewed article on stream daylighting was published in 1992 until the end of 2018 to analyze four themes: the disciplines and sub-disciplines of the literature; the terminologies and synonyms of stream daylighting; the definitions of stream daylighting; and the case studies tackled in the literature. • We develop a method that combines a systematic review of the stream daylighting literature and inductive content analysis. • The method provides insights on the stream daylighting's literature's disciplines, terminologies, synonyms and case studies. • The method is adaptable particularly, to nascent areas of study where sources’ numbers range between 100-200. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.ufug.2019.126544;Research on urban forests has expanded in the last 30 years in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, urban forestry has been explored to much less extent in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, despite being one of the most urbanized and biodiverse regions in the world. We address this gap by providing a baseline understanding of urban forest research in the region based on a systematic review of the academic literature. Of the 55,000 studies found, 195 were selected for review, and 182 were analysed and synthesized. These studies came from 13 countries and were published from 1970 to mid-2018 (inclusive) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Almost half of the studies were based in Brazil, followed by Mexico and Chile. To comparatively assess article output by country, we accounted for country population and Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico had higher than average per capita article output. Most articles were ecological studies (64%) that used field surveys (58%) to research urban vegetation diversity. Most ecological studies did not include any social or management considerations. Only a few studies focused on spatiotemporal dynamics (12%) or the direct opinions of stakeholders (9%). We observed a notable increase in article output from the region during the last decade. The units of analysis targeted by these studies mostly focused on single trees in public areas (streets and parks). Understanding urban forests regionally could be strengthened by scaling up research across multiple units of analysis and across regional cities, which could provide a better understanding of regional spatiotemporal dynamics. To respond to current global trends and nurture regional strengths, research could also focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by urban forests, and the relationship of urban forests with poverty, crime, climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and social equity. These findings can inform key stakeholders in the region managing urban forests and trees about research trends and gaps to be filled. This article shows that the region indeed has an important body of research in urban forestry that should be recognized in global assessments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.cities.2019.102483;Cities face increasing environmental, social and economic challenges that together threaten the resilience of urban areas and the residents who live and work there. These challenges include chronic stresses and acute shocks, amplified by climate change impacts. Nature-based solutions have emerged as a concept for integrating ecosystem-based approaches to address a range of societal challenges. Nature-based solutions directly address and contribute to increased urban resilience. However, implementing nature-based solutions is inherently complex, given the range of ecosystem services, their multi-functionality and the trade-offs between functions, and across temporal and spatial scales. Urban planning can play a substantial role to support the implementation of nature-based solutions and to manage trade-offs and conflicts, as well as how social equity dimensions are considered. This paper presents a framework that guides the application of urban planning to nature-based solutions’ implementation, by addressing key trade-offs across temporal, spatial, functional and social equity aspects. The framework highlights the key questions, and the supporting information required to address these questions, to underpin the inclusion of nature-based solutions for urban resilience. We find that while urban planning can contribute substantially, there are continuing gaps in how the inherently anthropocentric urban planning processes can give voice to non-human nature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1186/s13750-019-0180-4;Background: The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept embracing concepts such as Green/Blue/Nature Infrastructure, Ecosystem Approach, Ecosystem Services, but at their core, they cluster into the general theme of learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems, which enhance human well-being (HWB). NBS address societal challenges across a broad range of spatial scales - local, regional and global - and temporal scales - medium to long-term. While there are many reviews and a clear evidence base linking certain NBS to various elements of HWB, particularly urban greenspace and human health, no comprehensive mapping exists of the links between NBS interventions and the associated multiple positive and negative HWB outcomes across a range of habitats. The initial research phase used a participatory co-design process to select four priority societal challenges facing the United Kingdom: three related to management issues i.e. NBS cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the fourth threats to the acoustic environment. These challenges collectively address priority management issues which stakeholders requested be investigated widely i.e. across landscapes, cityscapes, seascapes and soundscapes. Results of the study are intended to identify and define potential future environmental evidence challenges for UK science. Methods: This protocol describes the methodology for approaching the research question: What evidence is there for nature based solutions and their impacts on human wellbeing for societal challenges related to cost-efficacy, governance in planning, environmental justice, and the acoustic environment? Using systematic mapping, this study will search for and identify studies that seek to assess nature-based solutions on human well-being with regard to these four societal challenges. Systematic searches across a number of academic/online databases are tested against a number of test articles. Search results are refined using eligibility criteria through a three stage process: title, abstract, full text. Data from screened studies are extracted using a predefined coding strategy. Key trends in data will be synthesized according to a range of secondary questions and be presented in a graphical matrix illustrating the knowledge gaps and clusters for research into nature-based solutions and human well-being for each societal challenge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1098/rspb.2019.1550;Nature-based agriculture that reduces dependency on chemical inputs requires using ecological principles for sustainable agro-ecosystems, aiming to balance ecology, economics and social justice. There is growing evidence that pollinator-dependent crops with high insect, particularly bee, pollination service can give higher yields. However, the interacting effects between insect pollination and agricultural inputs on crop yields and farm economics remain to be established to reconcile food production with biodiversity conservation. We quantified individual and combined effects of pesticides, insect pollination and soil quality on oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) yield and gross margin, using a total of 294 farmers’ fields surveyed between 2013 and 2016. We show that yield and gross margins are greater (15–40%) in fields with higher pollinator abundance than in fields with reduced pollinator abundance. This effect is, however, strongly reduced by pesticide use. Greater yields may be achieved by either increasing agrochemicals or increasing bee abundance, but crop economic returns were only increased by the latter, because pesticides did not increase yields while their costs reduced gross margins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su11205838;Public access to high quality green environments has become a key issue for city managers and a matter of environmental justice. Urban pressures on ecosystem remnants may act to favor the expansion of some invasive species in cities. Whilst the negative impacts of invasive species on ecosystem function is well documented, little is known about how invasive species influence the use of green space by people. Here, we examined one of the few remnants of urban riparian forests in Europe, the Vistula river valley inWarsaw, which has recently become an attractive recreation site. Despite their high ecological value, the poplar and willow forests have been increasingly taken over by the invasive tree species Acer negundo. We examined the status of the invasion process and the relationship between recreational ecosystem services and the characteristics of the tree stands-tree species, tree density, and age and NDVI values. We found the willow forest to be more susceptible to invasion by A. negundo than the poplar forest, which was revealed in significantly higher share of the maple individuals and their greater volume per unit area. Ash-leaved maples also prevailed in numbers in younger stands ( < 10 years) than in older ones. The presence of A. negundo affected biodiversity, resulting in decreased undergrowth density and biodiversity expressed in number of species. The use intensity by the public, assessed on the basis of soil compaction of existing informal tracks, as revealed by GLM analysis, was related to volume of invasive maple and distance from the main track. This study highlights the need to integrate invasive species management into green infrastructure planning and management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/su11184924;Urbanization deletes and degrades natural ecosystems, threatens biodiversity, and alienates people from the experience of nature. Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.3390/LAND8070112;With the notion of landscape urbanism long neglected, interlinkages between ecology and architecture in the built environment are becoming visible. Yet, the diversity in understandings of the interconnections between cities and nature is the starting point for our research interest. This volume contains nine thoroughly refereed contributions concerning a wide range of topics in landscape architecture and urban green infrastructure. While some papers attempt to conceptualize the relation further, others clearly have an empirical focus. Thereby, this special issue provides a rich body of work, and will act as a starting point for further studies on biophilic urbanism and integrative policies, such as the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.030;Urbanization is a global trend, and consequently the quality of urban environments is increasingly important for human health and wellbeing. Urban life-style is typically associated with low physical activity and sometimes with high mental stress, both contributing to an increasing burden of diseases. Nature-based solutions that make effective use of ecosystem services, particularly of cultural ecosystem services (CES), can provide vital building blocks to address these challenges. This paper argues that, the salutogenic, i.e. health-promoting effects of CES have so far not been adequately recognised and deserve more explicit attention in order to enhance decision making around health and wellbeing in urban areas. However, a number of research challenges will need to be addressed to reveal the mechanisms, which underpin delivery of urban CES. These include: causal chains of supply and demand, equity, and equality of public health benefits promoted. Methodological challenges in quantifying these are discussed. The paper is highly relevant for policy makers within and beyond Europe, and also serves as a review for current researchers and as a roadmap to future short- and long-term research opportunities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
10.1002/eet.1795;"Increasing climate change impacts are a major threat to sustainable urban development, and challenge current governance structures, including actors' responsibilities for dealing with climate variability and extremes. The need for distributed risk governance and citizen engagement is increasingly recognised; however, few empirical studies systematically assess interactions between citizens and municipalities in climate risk management and adaptation. Here, we develop an explorative framework, applied to three Swedish municipalities, to map existing ‘adaptation interactions’ and analyse how responsibilities for climate adaptation manifest and are (re)negotiated. The results show that adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, despite positive adaptation outcomes from related local processes. Structures and mechanisms for systematic monitoring and learning are also lacking. We argue that fostering collaborations with citizens – to support long-term adaptation and reduce the adaptation burden of those most at risk – requires consideration of four strategic issues: proactive engagement; equity and ‘responsibilisation’; nature-based approaches; and systematic adaptation mainstreaming. Finally, we discuss how our analytical framework can contribute to further theorising municipalities' engagement with citizens on climate risk. © 2017 The Authors.

10.5751/ES-08373-210239;"Nature-based solutions promoting green and blue urban areas have significant potential to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of cities in light of climatic change. They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.11.003;Climate change impacts increase pressure on challenges to sustainability and the developmental needs of cities. Conventional, hard adaptation measures are often associated with high costs, inflexibility and conflicting interests related to the dense urban fabric, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has emerged as a potentially cost-efficient, comprehensive, and multifunctional approach. This paper reviews and systematises research on urban EbA. We propose an analytical framework that draws on theory from ecosystem services, climate change adaptation and sustainability science. It conceptualises EbA in terms of five linked components: ecological structures, ecological functions, adaptation benefits, valuation, and ecosystem management practices.Our review identified 110 articles, reporting on 112 cities, and analysed them using both quantitative statistical and qualitative content analysis. We found that EbA research in an urban context is fragmented due to different disciplinary approaches and concepts. Most articles focus on heat or flooding, and the most studied ecological structures for reducing the risk of such hazards are green space, wetlands, trees and parks. EbA is usually evaluated in bio-geophysical terms and the use of economic or social valuations are rare. While most articles do not mention specific practices for managing ecological structures, those that do imply that urban EbA strategies are increasingly being integrated into institutional structures. Few articles considered issues of equity or stakeholder participation in EbA.We identified the following challenges for future EbA research. First, while the large amount of data generated by isolated case studies contributes to systems knowledge, there is a lack of systems perspectives that position EbA in relation to the wider socio-economic and bio-geophysical context. Second, normative and ethical aspects of EbA require more thought, such as who are the winners and losers, especially in relation to processes that put people at risk from climate-related hazards. Third, there is room for more forward-looking EbA research, including consideration of future scenarios, experimentation in the creation of new ecological structures and the role of EbA in transformative adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
x;"In recent years, cities such as New York, Toronto, Paris and Milan have drafted frameworks implementing innovative strategies aimed to a radical change of paradigm in the concepts of food production and consumption. These strategies promise to diversify and promote efficient and sustainable food supply and distribution systems in terms of resources, management, reduction and prevention of food waste. Food policies adopted from these and other cities, place urban food systems as the beating heart of the sustainable development highlighting the link between climate, energy, natural resources, equity and social inclusion. In this paradigm, food policies therefore assume a fundamental role in issues closely related to the resilience of urban territorial systems. Among the experiences that move in this direction are those of urban agriculture and, in particular the Rooftop Farming. Starting from this background, the focus of the study moves on the urban space of the City of Buenos Aires and on the possibility of defining a new urban governance model for the city through the large-scale implementation of Rooftop Farming technology; a model that considers food as an urban infrastructure and a constitutive element of the City itself. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved."
